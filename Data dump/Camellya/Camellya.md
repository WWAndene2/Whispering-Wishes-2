## Kit

### Active skills — Burgeoning

**Basic Attack**: up to 5 attacks, Havoc DMG. After Basic Attack Stage 3 or Heavy Attack Pruning, hold
Normal Attack to continuously strike. Stage 4 auto-follows into Stage 5.
**Heavy Attack**: consumes STA, Havoc DMG.
**Mid-air Attack**: Plunging Attack, consumes STA, Havoc DMG.
**Dodge Counter**: Basic Attack after successful Dodge, Havoc DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Basic Attack 1 DMG | 62.53% |
| Basic Attack 2 DMG | 46.48%×2 |
| Basic Attack 3 DMG | 50.70%×3 |
| Basic Attack 4 DMG | 24.70%×20 |
| Basic Attack 5 DMG | 48.17%×4 |
| Heavy Attack DMG | 88.14%×3 |
| Mid-air Attack DMG | 65.61%×2 |
| Dodge Counter DMG | 99.40%×3 |
| Heavy Attack STA Cost | 25 |
| Plunging Attack STA Cost | 30 |

### Resonance Skill — Valse of Bloom and Blight

**Crimson Blossom**: attack the target, Havoc DMG (considered Basic Attack DMG), enters **Blossom
Mode**. Castable mid-air.
**Blossom Mode** (movement locked, dodges/jumps still allowed): Basic Attack + Heavy Attack Pruning →
**Vining Waltz** (4-hit combo, considered Basic Attack DMG; holding at Stage 3 casts **Blazing Waltz**
before auto-continuing to Stage 4). Dodge Counter → **Atonement** (considered Basic Attack DMG).
Resonance Skill → **Floral Ravage** (considered Basic Attack DMG, castable mid-air, ends Blossom Mode
on cast). Jump → **Vining Ronde** (consumes STA, considered Basic Attack DMG, ends Blossom Mode).
Blossom Mode also ends when the Levitator is used. Vining Waltz/Blazing Waltz mid-air and staying
suspended on vines both consume STA continuously; Floral Ravage does not restore STA.

| | |
|---|---|
| Crimson Blossom DMG | 113.62%×2 |
| Vining Waltz 1 DMG | 96.33% |
| Vining Waltz 2 DMG | 45.63%×2 |
| Vining Waltz 3 DMG | 21.95%×6 |
| Vining Waltz 4 DMG | 67.59%×3 |
| Blazing Waltz DMG | 21.95%×19 |
| Floral Ravage DMG | 52.61%×5 |
| Vining Ronde DMG | 52.95%×3 |
| Atonement DMG | 113.33%×2 |
| Cooldown | 4s |
| Crimson Blossom Concerto Regen | 7 |
| Floral Ravage Concerto Regen | 7 |
| Vining Waltz 1-4 / Blazing Waltz / Vining Ronde STA Cost | 5 each |
| STA Cost Per Second When Suspended | 5 |

### Resonance Liberation — Fervor Efflorescent
Attack the target, Havoc DMG. Castable mid-air.

| | |
|---|---|
| Skill Damage | 1202.81% |
| Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Energy Cost | 125 |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Forte Circuit — Vegetative Universe

Hitting a target with Normal Attack, Vining Waltz, Blazing Waltz, Vining Ronde, Atonement, Crimson
Blossom, or Floral Ravage consumes **Crimson Pistils** (that hit's Energy Regen Multiplier is +150%
while doing so). Every 10 Crimson Pistils consumed recovers 4 Concerto Energy and grants 1 **Crimson
Bud** (15s duration each, stacks to 10).

**Ephemeral**: when Concerto Energy is fully recovered and Ephemeral is off cooldown, Resonance Skill
is replaced by Ephemeral — consumes 70 Concerto Energy, deals Havoc DMG (considered Basic Attack DMG),
castable mid-air, enters **Budding Mode**.

**Budding Mode — Sweet Dream**: +50% DMG Multiplier to Normal Attack/Vining Waltz/Blazing Waltz/Vining
Ronde/Atonement/Crimson Blossom/Floral Ravage. Casting Ephemeral consumes ALL Crimson Buds; each Bud
consumed adds a further +5% to Sweet Dream's Multiplier (up to +50% more at 10 stacks, so up to +100%
total). While in Budding Mode, Camellya cannot gain new Crimson Buds, and Energy Regen Multiplier on
those same hits drops to 0%. Budding Mode ends when switched off-field or when all Crimson Pistils are
consumed.

**Crimson Pistil** (cap 100): fully restored by casting Intro Skill Everblooming, and by activating
Ephemeral.

| | |
|---|---|
| Ephemeral DMG | 1262.45% |
| Budding Mode Duration | 15s |
| Ephemeral Cooldown | 25s |

### Inherent Skills
- **Seedbed**: Havoc DMG Bonus +15%. Heavy Attack Pruning's DMG is now considered Basic Attack DMG.
- **Epiphyte**: Basic DMG Bonus +15%. Increased interruption resistance while casting Basic Attack/
  Vining Waltz/Blazing Waltz.

### Intro Skill — Everblooming
Havoc DMG. Multiplier: 198.81%. Concerto Regen 10.

### Outro Skill — Twining
Havoc DMG equal to 329.24% ATK. After activating Forte Circuit's Ephemeral, the NEXT Outro Twining
deals an ADDITIONAL 459.02% ATK Havoc DMG on top (strict cast-order dependency, not unconditional).

### Resonance Chain (Dupes)
- **S1**: Casting Everblooming → Crit DMG +28% for 18s (once per 25s). Immune to interruption while
  casting Ephemeral.
- **S2**: Ephemeral's DMG Multiplier +120%.
- **S3**: Fervor Efflorescent's DMG Multiplier +50%. While in Budding Mode, ATK +58%.
- **S4**: Casting Everblooming grants the whole team +25% Basic Attack DMG Bonus for 30s.
- **S5**: Everblooming's DMG Multiplier +303%; Twining's DMG Multiplier +68%.
- **S6**: Sweet Dream's (Budding Mode's) DMG Multiplier is additionally increased by +150%. Unlocks
  **Forte Circuit: Perennial** — within 15s of casting Ephemeral, if Concerto Energy is full and
  Perennial is off cooldown, Resonance Skill is replaced by Perennial: consumes 50 Concerto Energy,
  recovers 50 Crimson Pistils, deals Havoc DMG equal to 100% of Ephemeral's DMG (considered Basic
  Attack DMG, 25s internal cooldown), enters Budding Mode and removes all Crimson Buds (Sweet Dream's
  bonus Multiplier becomes 250% instead of the base progression). Immune to interruption while casting
  Perennial.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Crit DMG +16%, ATK% +12%.

### Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 10325 / ATK 450 / DEF 1161 / Max Energy 125 / Crit Rate 5% / Crit DMG 150% / Healing Bonus 0% /
Havoc DMG 0%.

## Review

- DPS Tier: T2 (Tower of Adversity), T3 (Whimpering Wastes). Value Tier List: T3 (ToA Value), T2 (WW
  Value) — note this is the REVERSE of the standard Ratings figures above.
- **Pros**: super F2P-friendly AoE DPS — usable with fully free teammates/weapons for great results;
  can flex between AoE- and single-target-oriented playstyles; great Sequence value vs. most 1.x
  characters; "Spin to win!"
- **Cons**: very old kit, no rerun in ages to capitalize on her strong Sequences, behind the current
  damage ceiling despite teammate/Echo upgrades since release; highly interruption-prone on her
  biggest-damage attack until S1 (Inherent Skills don't grant full immunity during her spins) —
  inconsistent vs. bosses; White Hair rotation is too long to be DPS-optimal (relies on poor tracking
  against bosses); even the faster Red Hair rotation is the LONGEST DPS rotation in the game — Outro
  buffs frequently expire before her highest-damage window (Budding Mode); her premium teammates get
  poached by stronger characters, often leaving weaker fallbacks (Sanhua, Danjin).
- 5★ Havoc Sword Main DPS with arguably the longest rotation of any Main DPS in the game. Deals the
  largest share of Echo damage among non-Echo-focused DPS characters thanks to her dedicated Echo
  (Nightmare: Crownless), woven into her rotation via Echo Animation Cancels (not many Swap Cancels).
- Key mechanics: fills Concerto twice per rotation — once for the enhanced Skill (Ephemeral), once for
  the actual Outro. Forte gauge (Crimson Pistils, cap 100) only restores via Intro and Ephemeral itself
  — rotating before Intro is available makes little progress toward her real damage.
  Skill toggles between White Hair (ground-locked movement, longer/more single-target attacks) and Red
  Hair/Blossom Mode (movement-locked except dodge/jump, faster/more AoE attacks). Basic Attacks in
  either form build up to 10 Crimson Buds, each empowering the post-Ephemeral state further.
  Ephemeral (70 Concerto Energy) enters Budding Mode: +50% DMG Multiplier (+5% per Crimson Bud
  consumed) to nearly all attacks except the Ultimate; ends on swap-out or when Crimson Pistils run out.
- Rotation/shortcomings: fastest Pistil consumption is holding Basic Attack immediately after entering
  Red Hair mode (a wide-AoE spin). Requires 2 full spin casts + 2 Skill casts (enter/exit Red Hair) +
  Intro + Ultimate — total rotation exceeds 15s, meaning 14s Outro buffs from teammates often expire
  before Budding Mode (her biggest damage chunk) even starts. Getting interrupted (including during
  Ephemeral, which fully cancels its huge damage) makes this worse.
- Meta position: massive F2P upsides (Sanhua/Danjin teammates, Emerald of Genesis F2P weapon) undercut
  by rotation length/inconsistency and a stagnant teammate pool (Lynae/Mornye's release barely moved
  the needle) — a budget/low-standard option rather than a valuable investment in the current meta.

## Build

**Best Weapons** (calc build used Lynae+Mornye buffs): Red Spring (R1, signature) 100.00% — ATK+12%;
Basic Attack DMG hit → +10% Basic Attack DMG Bonus for 14s (stacks ×3, 1/s); Concerto Energy consumed →
+40% Basic DMG Bonus for 10s (1/s, ends on swap-out) — built specifically around her unique
mid-rotation Concerto-spend mechanic, by far her best weapon. Emerald Sentence (R1) 90.10% — surprising
alternative sharing Red Spring's base stats, heavy Echo Skill DMG focus (which Camellya uses a lot via
Crownless); also team-wide +20% Echo Skill DMG on Intro. Frostburn (R1) 89.50% and Everbright Polestar
(R1) 89.40% — simple ATK/Crit-Rate or DMG-Bonus stat-sticks for her (their Glacio Chafe/Tune Rupture
passives don't apply to her). Emerald of Genesis (R1) 89.20% — explicitly called the "best PERMANENT
option" despite the slightly lower %: ER+12.8%, Skill cast → ATK+6% ×2 stacks (10s); an excellent,
easily-obtainable alternative to the signature. Blazing Brilliance (R1) 88.40% — ATK/Crit DMG
stat-stick (no Skill-DMG synergy for her). 4★: Feather Edge (R5) 77.80% (Battle Pass exclusive, best
4★ — Liberation cast → ATK+23%/Lib DMG+34.5% for 15s), Lumingloss (R5) 76.80%, Somnoire Anchor (R5)
75.30% (event exclusive), Commando of Conviction (R5) 75.30% — best no-gacha/F2P option, obtainable
free at the start of the game.

**Best Echo Sets**: Havoc Eclipse (100%) — 2pc: Havoc DMG+10%; 5pc: Basic/Heavy Attack hit → Havoc
DMG+7.5%, stacks ×4 (15s), up to +30% more at full ramp (40% total). Main Echo: Nightmare: Crownless
(+12% Havoc DMG, +12% Basic Attack DMG unconditional in main slot — the set-bonus enabler). Alt:
Endless Resonance (94.58%) — 2pc: ATK+10%; 5pc: while on-field, ATK+5% every 1.5s (stacks ×4, so up to
+20% more, +30% total after 6s); Outro DMG+60%. Generically usable across any element/damage character,
close to but slightly behind her own signature elemental set. Main Echo: Mech Abomination (instant
cast, easy to slot right after Intro for burst-window ATK% + burst damage).

**Substats priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > Basic DMG% > ATK.
Without her signature, a Havoc DMG 3-cost Echo piece is always preferred over ATK%.

**Endgame stat targets (Lv.90)**: HP 15000+, DEF 1150+, ATK 2000-2200+, Crit Rate 55-80%+, Crit DMG
220-280%+, Energy Regen 115-128%+ (lower end in a Lynae+Shorekeeper team, higher end in a
Roccia+Shorekeeper team), Havoc DMG Bonus 70-100%+.

**Skill priority**: Resonance Skill > Forte Circuit > Resonance Liberation > Intro Skill > Basic Attack
(only worth leveling for enemy tracking in the White Hair rotation — otherwise skip it, it doesn't
help maximize Loop DPS against less mobile targets/more endgame resets).

## Gameplay and Teams

**Standard Rotation**: Intro → Skill: Crimson Blossom (cancel endlag via Echo) → Echo (Dash-cancel) →
Dash → Heavy: Vining Waltz 1 → 2 → 3 → Blazing Waltz → Vining Waltz 4 (cancel endlag via Echo) → Echo
(Dash-cancel) → Dash (cancel via Ultimate) → Ultimate → Basic: Vining Waltz 1 (cancel endlag via Skill)
→ Skill: Ephemeral → Heavy: Vining Waltz 1 → 2 → 3 → Blazing Waltz → Vining Waltz 4 (cancel endlag via
Skill) → Skill: Floral Ravage → Echo (Swap) → Outro.

**S6 Rotation**: same as Standard through the first Ephemeral/Budding-Mode combo, then instead of
immediately ending: Echo (Dash-cancel) → Dash → Basic: Vining Waltz 1 → Skill: Perennial → Heavy:
Vining Waltz 1 → 2 → 3 → Blazing Waltz → Vining Waltz 4 (cancel endlag via Skill) → Skill: Floral
Ravage (Swap) → Outro. Post-S6 rotation time: 22.62s.

**White Hair Rotation** (better enemy tracking, lower DPS, longer): Intro → Skill: Crimson Blossom →
Jump: Vining Ronde → Heavy Attack → Heavy: Basic 4 (full channel) → Ultimate (pressed before Basic 5
triggers) → Skill: Crimson Blossom → Jump: Vining Ronde → Heavy Attack → Heavy: Basic 4 (full channel)
→ Heavy: Basic 5 → Outro. At S6, an extra Skill (Perennial) can be cast after the final Basic 5 for
another Heavy→Basic 4 combo, but the extension is large enough that the standard S6 rotation is
recommended instead. Camellya's Ultimate may also be cast after only 4 total Basic Attack hits to
finish off Whimpering Wastes waves faster.

**Echo notes**: Echo timings in the rotations above are written specifically around Nightmare:
Crownless's Animation Cancel potential (Camellya's best Echo by far — much higher damage, better
buffs, and better Energy generation than the alternatives). Dreamless and normal Crownless are usable
but significantly lower her damage — if used, Dreamless goes at rotation's end, and normal Crownless
at the very start (Dash-cancelled).

**Synergies**: Lynae (best Hybrid choice — generalist buffs make Camellya's damage skyrocket). Roccia /
Sanhua (comparable premium options, both give strong ATK/Basic ATK DMG Amp buffs; Sanhua is the better
F2P pick and outperforms Roccia if Roccia lacks her signature). Danjin (fallback if Sanhua is taken
elsewhere — solid general Havoc DMG Amp on her Outro). Mornye (best paired specifically with Lynae —
Lynae applies Tune Rupture/Strain for Mornye to exploit for her full buff kit). The Shorekeeper (close
second to Mornye+Lynae — massive Crit buffs + other generalist buffs). Verina (most accessible strong
generalist option if neither Mornye nor Shorekeeper are available).

**Example Teams**: Best Team (Mornye is only best here when paired WITH Lynae specifically), Alternative
Team — exact roster icons weren't machine-readable in this extraction, names/conditions are directly
from the source text.

## Damage Profile (calc, solo, no team buffs)
Basic 67.1% (319,984) / Liberation 16.5% (78,645) / Echo (16,260) / Intro (12,217) / Outro (49,675) /
Heavy 0 / Skill 0. Rotation time 15.5s. S0: 476,781 DMG (30,756 DPS). Post-S6 rotation time: 22.62s,
S6: 1,640,538 DMG (72,532 DPS).
Calc build used: weapon Emerald of Genesis (R1), Echo set Havoc Eclipse, main Echo Nightmare: Crownless.
Team buffs applied in the calc: Lynae + Spectrum Blaster + Pact of Neonlight Leap + Hyvatia; Mornye +
Discord + Halo of Starry Radiance + Reactor Husk.

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `camellya.blocks.js`)

No dump file existed before this pass — created. CHAR_BUFF_TABLE (Seedbed/Epiphyte), RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA
(S1-S6, including the S5 dual-multiplier split), base stats, `bestWeapon` (Red Spring), and `bestEchoes`
(Nightmare: Crownless + Havoc Eclipse 5pc) all already matched this source exactly, and
`camellya.blocks.js`'s TriggerBlocks engine was already correctly audited for everything it modeled
(2026-08-31/09-01 passes).

**Real bugs found and fixed (2026-09-03)**:
1. `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['Camellya']` was missing 5 rows present in this source: Mid-air Attack (65.61%×2),
   Dodge Counter (99.40%×3), Floral Ravage (52.61%×5), Vining Ronde (52.95%×3), Atonement (113.33%×2).
   **Floral Ravage was the consequential one**: `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Camellya']` already casts
   `Skill:Floral Ravage` as its Blossom-Mode-ending step, so with no matching multiplier row that step
   was silently resolving to 0 DMG — the same zero-damage-rotation-step bug class found on ~10 other
   characters this project. Added the row, and a matching `camellya.skill.floral-ravage` damage block
   in `camellya.blocks.js` (the block set had no block for this move at all before this pass).
2. The DPS-tier table entry was `['Camellya', 'T3', 'T2']` (ToA/WW) — a straight swap. This source's
   Ratings section clearly lists T2 (ToA) / T3 (WW); its separate Value Tier List is the one that shows
   T3(ToA)/T2(WW) — the app's tier-table convention (established across many other characters' audit
   comments) matches the standard Ratings section, not the Value list. Fixed to `['Camellya', 'T2', 'T3']`.

`weaponAlts` (`alt5: ['Emerald Sentence', 'Emerald of Genesis']`, `alt4: ['Feather Edge', 'Lumingloss']`)
was checked and left as-is: Emerald Sentence (90.10%) is the #2 overall pick, and while Frostburn
(89.50%) and Everbright Polestar (89.40%) technically outrank Emerald of Genesis (89.20%) in raw %, the
source explicitly calls both of those "simple stat-sticks" the character "does not benefit from" beyond
raw stats, while separately calling Emerald of Genesis the "best PERMANENT option ... excellent
alternative to her Signature" — the same "weapon rank isn't purely about raw calculated %" methodology
already documented elsewhere in this project (e.g. Mortefi's dump). alt4 top-2-by-% already matches
exactly (Feather Edge 77.80% > Lumingloss 76.80%).

1 new test added (Floral Ravage block existence + rotation-usage check), full suite green (1331/1331).

**Full re-audit (2026-09-08, explicitly requested — including cross-interactions and how
`condition.requiresStance` actually behaves in the resolver, not just re-checking what the multiple
prior passes already touched).** Found one real, significant bug plus one confirmed real omission,
both centered on the same root cause.

**`condition.requiresStance` is purely descriptive in this engine — it was never actually enforced.**
`triggerEngine.js`'s own `conditionHolds()` has an explicit comment saying so: no state machine tracks
which stance is active; only a SEPARATE mechanism (`filterExclusiveModeBlocks`, for genuinely rival
"Mode A vs Mode B" block pairs like Denia's Tune Strain vs Fusion Burst) ever acts on it. Two of
Camellya's Resonance Chain blocks relied SOLELY on `requiresStance: 'Budding Mode'` with no rival to
be excluded against — meaning they were silently, permanently active for her WHOLE rotation instead of
the real ~15s window that opens on her Forte Ephemeral cast:
1. `camellya.chain.s3-a-bud-adorned-by-thorns` (ATK+58%) — a prior session's own comment in
   `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Camellya']` already suspected this exact gap ("TODO: verify calc engine
   gates this on Budding Mode state rather than applying it unconditionally") but left it unverified.
2. `camellya.chain.s6-bloom-for-you-thousand-times-over` (Sweet Dream's own +150% additional DMG
   Multiplier) — worse in practice, since it's scoped to `camellya.skill.vining-waltz-combo`, a block
   that fires TWICE in her modeled rotation (once before Ephemeral, once after) — the unenforced
   condition meant BOTH occurrences got the bonus, not just the real post-Ephemeral one.

Both re-anchored to a real `resource-threshold` trigger (the same one `camellya.forte.ephemeral` itself
already uses) + `timing.duration: 15`, matching `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Camellya']`'s own `duration: 15`
already declared on that step — a genuine windowed buff now, not a decorative condition.

This same investigation also surfaced a real, previously-untouched test file
(`triggerEngineRequiresStanceGap.test.js`) whose own header comment claimed Camellya's Budding Mode
blocks were "legitimately always applicable per her own kit" — that claim is factually wrong (Budding
Mode is a real, temporary state, not always-on); the comment conflated "no rival to exclude against"
with "therefore always-on." Corrected the comment and the one test it backed.

**Real omission found in the same pass: the BASE (non-Sequence-gated) Forte Circuit "Sweet Dream"
mechanic had no block at all, at ANY sequence level.** This dump's own Forte Circuit text (and
`CHARACTER_DATA['Camellya'].desc`/`CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Camellya']`'s own step notes, both already
extensively documenting it in prose) describe a guaranteed +50% DMG Multiplier in Budding Mode (up to
+100% with Crimson Buds consumed on Ephemeral cast) to 7 named move types — covering her single biggest
damage share (67.1% Basic ATK). This was missing from BOTH the modern engine and
`CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Camellya']` (the legacy engine's equivalent). Added a new
`camellya.selfbuff.sweet-dream` block using the same real 15s post-Ephemeral window, scoped to the same
2 real damage blocks the S6 node already targets — modeled at the guaranteed floor (+50%) since the
variable +0-50% Crimson-Bud bonus can't be derived without a full Pistil-economy simulation this schema
doesn't have (never fabricated). Flagged, but not added, to the legacy `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE` — its
`selfBuffs` array has no real time-windowing mechanism, so adding a flat/always-on entry there would
create a NEW overstatement bug (100% uptime instead of ~15s of a much longer rotation) worse than the
current omission.

Everything else re-verified clean: `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`, `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`, `weaponAlts`'s own
"weapon rank isn't purely about raw %" reasoning (confirmed still correctly justified, unlike a
similar-looking case just fixed for Calcharo), `dmgFocus`, base stats, and cross-character interactions
(nothing else in the roster references Blossom/Budding Mode or Crimson Pistils/Buds).

**Flagged for a separate decision, not fixed here:** the same "`requiresStance` alone, no rival, no
real duration backing it, silently degrades to always-on" pattern likely affects other characters too
— at least Yinlin's S5 (Resounding Will), which `rotationSimulator.test.js`'s own comment already
documents as relying on exactly this unenforced behavior. A roster-wide sweep for this specific pattern
was out of scope for a single-character audit but is a real, concrete follow-up worth doing.

phase3-parityGolden.test.js caught real, expected drift — refreshed the golden fixture (net damage
increased: the previously-missing base Sweet Dream block outweighs the S3/S6 duration restriction);
the pre-existing EXPECTED_DIVERGENCES band still holds. Added positive-verification tests proving the
Budding-Mode-gated buffs now only affect real post-Ephemeral hits, not the whole rotation. Full suite
green (1800/1800).
