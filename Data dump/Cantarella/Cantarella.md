last updated 20/August/2026. 5★ Havoc Rectifier Hybrid (DPS/Buffer/Healer).

## Kit

### Active skills — Illusion Collapse

**Basic Attack**: up to 3 attacks, Havoc DMG.
**Heavy Attack**: consumes STA, Havoc DMG.
**Heavy Attack - Delusive Dive**: with Trance, Heavy Attack becomes Delusive Dive, Havoc DMG, then
enters Mirage. Castable in water.
**Mid-air Attack**: consumes STA, Plunging Attack, Havoc DMG.
**Dodge Counter**: Basic Attack after successful Dodge, Havoc DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Stage 1 DMG | 79.53% |
| Stage 2 DMG | 36.44%×4 |
| Stage 3 DMG | 72.57%×2 |
| Heavy Attack DMG | 57.18%×2 |
| Delusive Dive DMG | 53.05%×2 |
| Mid-air Attack DMG | 41.99% + 62.99% |
| Dodge Counter DMG | 53.01%×4 |
| Heavy Attack STA Cost | 20 |
| Delusive Dive STA Cost | 20 |
| Mid-air Attack STA Cost | 30 |

### Resonance Skill — Dance with Shadows

**Graceful Step**: attacks the target, Havoc DMG.
**Flickering Reverie**: when in Mirage, Skill becomes Flickering Reverie (considered an Echo Skill) —
Havoc DMG, sends the target into **Hazy Dream** (6.5s move-speed reduction; on taking damage, triggers
**Jolt** once, removing Hazy Dream for a Havoc DMG hit considered Basic Attack DMG — other teammates'
attacks remove Hazy Dream without Jolting; Coordinated Attacks/Utility damage never Jolt). Castable
mid-air.

| | |
|---|---|
| Graceful Step DMG | 73.60%×2 |
| Flickering Reverie DMG | 196.23% |
| Jolt DMG | 198.81% |
| Graceful Step Cooldown | 6s |
| Flickering Reverie Cooldown | 12s |

### Resonance Liberation — Beneath the Sea

**Flowing Suffocation**: Havoc DMG (considered Basic Attack DMG), grants **Diffusion** to the whole
team. Casting this is also considered casting Echo Skill. Castable mid-air near ground.
**Diffusion**: when the on-field Resonator deals damage, summons Dreamweavers for Coordinated Attacks
(Havoc DMG, considered Basic Attack DMG) — up to 1 per second (Dreamweaver damage doesn't itself
retrigger it), max 21 total, lasting 30s or until the cap is hit.

| | |
|---|---|
| Flowing Suffocation DMG | 376.00% |
| Diffusion DMG | 14.54%×21 |
| Flowing Suffocation Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Cost | 125 |
| Flowing Suffocation Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Forte Circuit — Between Illusion and Reality

**Mirage**: Basic Attack → **Phantom Sting** (up to 3 hits, castable mid-air, combo doesn't reset while
airborne). Hitting with Phantom Sting consumes 1 Trance for 1 Shiver and heals nearby team. Stage 3
triggers 3 Coordinated Attacks. Mid-air Attack → **Abysmal Vortex**. Dodge Counter → **Shadowy Sweep**
(Basic Attack right after → Phantom Sting Stage 2). Abysmal Vortex/Shadowy Sweep hits also consume 1
Trance for 1 Shiver + team heal. Lasts 8s, ends early when Trance is depleted.
**Perception Drain**: at 3 Shiver in Mirage, Skill becomes Perception Drain — consumes all Shiver,
Havoc DMG (considered Basic Attack DMG), sends target into Hazy Dream, heals the team. Also considered
Echo Skill cast. Castable mid-air.
**Abyssal Rebirth**: after Intro, entered for 25s (re-triggerable every 25s) — up to 6 times, any
teammate's Echo Skill cast restores 6 Concerto Energy (no duplicate echo name twice). In water: faster
swimming, lower STA cost.
**Trance** (cap 5): +1 on Intro cast, +1 on Basic Attack Stage 3 hit, +1 on Graceful Step cast, +3 on
Flowing Suffocation cast, +1 every 5s while in water.
**Shiver** (cap 3): +1 on Phantom Sting hit, +1 on Abysmal Vortex/Shadowy Sweep hit.

| | |
|---|---|
| Phantom Sting Stage 1 DMG | 35.33%×3 |
| Phantom Sting Stage 2 DMG | 62.93%×2 |
| Phantom Sting Stage 3 DMG | 64.62%×4 |
| Abysmal Vortex DMG | 41.99% + 62.99% |
| Perception Drain DMG | 667.99%×2 |
| Shadowy Sweep DMG | 75.09%×3 |
| Healing by Consuming Trance | 171 flat + 45.36% ATK |
| Perception Drain Healing | 712 flat + 189.00% ATK |
| Mirage Duration | 8s |
| Perception Drain Cooldown | 18s |

### Inherent Skills
- **Cure**: Healing Bonus +20%.
- **Poison**: casting Echo Skill → Havoc DMG Bonus +6% for 10s, stacking up to 2 times.

### Intro Skill — Cruise

**Ripple**: attacks the target, Havoc DMG. Pressing Basic Attack shortly after starts the combo from
Stage 3.
**Tidal Surge**: when in Mirage, Intro becomes Tidal Surge — 3 Coordinated Attacks on hit, Havoc DMG,
resets the Phantom Sting combo (per this source's own Review: this variant is essentially never
realistically used, since it has no benefit over the normal case).

| | |
|---|---|
| Ripple DMG | 42.25%×4 |
| Tidal Surge DMG | 16.90%×3 + 118.30% |

### Outro Skill — Gentle Tentacles
Amplifies the incoming Resonator's Havoc DMG by 20% and Resonance Skill DMG by 25% for 14s. Ends early
if that Resonator is switched out.

### Resonance Chain (Dupes)
- **S1**: Casting Resonance Skill restores 1 Trance. DMG Multiplier of Graceful Step, Flickering
  Reverie, and Perception Drain +50%. Immune to interruption while casting Perception Drain.
- **S2**: Flowing Suffocation now sends the target into Hazy Dream. Jolt's DMG Multiplier +245%.
- **S3**: Flowing Suffocation's DMG Multiplier +370%. After casting it, enters Mirage (no re-trigger if
  already in Mirage).
- **S4**: While in Mirage, Healing Bonus +25%.
- **S5**: Max Dreamweavers summonable via Diffusion +5.
- **S6**: Phantom Sting's DMG Multiplier +80%. Flowing Suffocation cast → DMG ignores 30% target DEF
  for 10s. For the first 1.2s of Hazy Dream, a non-Hazy-Dream-inflicting hit won't trigger Jolt.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Crit Rate +8%, ATK% +12%.

### Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 11600 / ATK 400 / DEF 1100 / Max Energy 125 / Crit Rate 5% / Crit DMG 150% / Healing Bonus 0% /
Havoc DMG 0%.

## Review

- DPS Tier (Hybrid): T3 (Tower of Adversity), T1.5 (Whimpering Wastes). Value Tier List: same, T3/T1.5.
- **Pros**: strong on/off-field presence via big on-field hits + Coordinated Attacks; works in many
  teams by amplifying both Skill and Havoc DMG; extra healing and enemy slows for comfort; lots of
  viable weapon choices, even F2P ones.
- **Cons**: huge Energy Regen requirements — may force an ER-main-stat Echo, hurting her damage
  significantly, and pushes ALL teammates to need more ER than usual too; no perfect meta-relevant team
  at time of release where she's the clear best-in-slot (though she has niche non-meta uses); her only
  differentiator from other Coordinated-Attacking Hybrids is extra healing, which many players don't
  need; playstyle "could be distracting" (author's own aside).
- 5★ Havoc Rectifier Hybrid filling DPS, off-field Coordinated-Attack DPS, healer, and buffer roles all
  at once via her Outro (Havoc + Resonance Skill DMG Amp). Complex kit — every ability synergizes and
  must be exploited correctly, with no single focal point (unlike most characters).
- Intro has 2 variants: "Ripple" (normal cast — the only realistically-used one, starts Basic Attack
  combo at Stage 3, +1 Trance) and "Tidal Surge" (only while already in Mirage — same damage, no
  special benefit, essentially never used). Both enter Abyssal Rebirth (Concerto Energy engine: +6
  Energy per any teammate's Echo Skill cast, up to 6 times per 25s window) — critical given her low
  base Resonance Energy generation relative to her 125 Energy Liberation cost.
- Rotation flow: Intro (Trance+1) → Basic Attack Stage 3 (Trance+1, the only Basic Attack tap
  realistically used) → Skill Graceful Step (Trance+1, generates Concerto) → Ultimate (overcaps Trance
  to 5/5, deals a solid burst counted as Basic ATK DMG + an Echo Skill for Abyssal Rebirth, activates
  Coordinated Attacks the same way Zhezhi's Ultimate does) → Delusive Dive (consumes all 5 Trance,
  enters Mirage) → enhanced Skill Flickering Reverie (instantly refreshed cooldown, an Echo Skill,
  applies Hazy Dream + auto-triggered Jolt follow-up) → Phantom Sting combo (builds Shiver) → Perception
  Drain at 3 Shiver (big nuke, heals the team, re-applies Hazy Dream, also an Echo Skill) → standard Echo
  cast (completes Abyssal Rebirth's 6-proc budget) → Outro.
- Biggest problem: Energy Regen. Her rotation genuinely doesn't generate enough energy, causing huge
  ripple problems for her AND her teammates (she needs Ultimate access every rotation). Solutions —
  Moonlit Clouds + an Energy-granting weapon (F2P options: Cosmic Ripples, Fusion Accretion), or worst
  case an ER-main-stat 3-cost Echo — all cost real damage, and none fully solve teammates' own Energy
  needs. Silver lining: her Havoc-element teammates don't suffer from this quite as badly.
- Lacks a genuinely ideal partner for her Outro's Havoc+Skill DMG Amp. Havoc Rover and Camellya deal
  most damage via Basic ATKs, which her buff doesn't target — Danjin actually buffs Camellya BETTER
  than Cantarella does (more Havoc Amp + an S6 ATK bonus), and Sanhua (free) or Roccia (premium) both
  outclass both of them for Camellya specifically. In Skill-DMG teams, Zhezhi/Yinlin outclass her as
  partners for Changli/Jinhsi (Brant is Changli's real ideal partner; pairing with Jinhsi actively hurts
  Jinhsi's own Ultimate-cast frequency unless built with extreme, damage-costly ER). Carlotta teams face
  the same doubled Energy-Regen-hunger problem while Brant/Zhezhi outclass her there too, without
  Carlotta/Cantarella's shared Energy issues.
- Overall: a genuinely solid character in isolation (damage, healing, enemy slows, flexibility), but her
  current lack of an uncontested best-in-slot team keeps her value more speculative than cemented —
  possibly resolved by a future DPS release, though a rerun bundled with such a DPS (following the
  Xiangli Yao/Yinlin, Carlotta/Zhezhi, Changli/Brant pattern) is equally plausible.

## Build

**Best Weapons** (calc build used Phrolova + Qiuyuan teammates): Whispers of Sirens (R1, her own
signature) 100.00% — "expectedly perfect for her" — ATK+12%, up to 40% Basic Attack DMG Bonus + 12%
Havoc RES Ignore (2 stacks), activating naturally quickly in her rotation. Rime-Draped Sprouts (R1,
Zhezhi's signature) 87.00% — ATK+12%, up to 12%×3 Basic Attack DMG Bonus (she has 3 real Skill casts to
exploit this) — an outstanding non-signature choice. Stringmaster (R1, Yinlin's signature) 85.00% —
ATK+12%, Crit Rate, All-Type DMG Bonus — "about equal to Zhezhi's Signature" for her specifically.
Lethean Elegy (R1, Phrolova's signature) 84.50% — theoretically offers 8% DEF Ignore via a Swap-Cancel
trick, but in practice its Echo-cast condition rarely triggers cleanly in her best teams (interrupting
an Echo cast for it isn't worth it) — mostly just a Crit Rate/ATK stat-stick. Luminous Hymn (R1) 82.60%
— simple ATK/Crit Rate stat-stick (Spectro Frazzle passive unusable). Cosmic Ripples (R1, listed as
"best PERMANENTLY AVAILABLE option for most Rectifier damage dealers") 82.50% — Basic Attack DMG + ER,
both stats she particularly benefits from. 4★: Radiant Dawn (R5, best 4★) 77.90% — Crit DMG + ATK/Basic
DMG Bonus on Skill cast. Augment (R5) 77.80% — Crit Rate + ATK on Ultimate cast, generally usable.
Fusion Accretion (R5, best non-Battle-Pass 4★) 71.80% — flat Resonance Energy, meaningfully lowers her
ER requirement. Jinzhou Keeper (R5, best fully F2P-accessible option) 68.40% — plain ATK% stat-stick.

**Best Echo Sets**: Midnight Veil (best set in ALL Havoc teams) — 2pc: Havoc DMG+10%; 5pc: Outro trigger
→ additional 480% Havoc DMG to surrounding enemies (considered Outro Skill DMG) + incoming Resonator
gains 15% Havoc DMG Bonus for 15s. Main Echo: Lorelei (her best Echo — +12% Havoc + 12% Basic Attack
DMG in main slot; a Transform Echo that must be cast before her rotation ends and Swap-Cancelled to
minimize rotation time). Alt: Moonlit Clouds (best set in ALL non-Havoc teams — sacrifices her personal
damage for stronger single-target buffing) — 2pc: ER+10%; 5pc: Outro cast → next Resonator ATK+22.5% for
15s, one of the strongest sets for buffing any ATK-scaling DPS. Main Echo: Impermanence Heron (the
best/only real option for this set — +12% DMG Bonus on top of the ATK boost to the next character, plus
a large Energy refund on hit; on Cantarella, use it before her rotation starts, or Instant-Cancel it via
her Ultimate to preserve the buff without spending its Energy/damage).

**Substats priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > ATK = Basic ATK
DMG%.

**Endgame stat targets (Lv.90)**: HP 16000+, DEF 1100+, ATK 1950-2400+, Crit Rate 65-80%+, Crit DMG
210-280%+, Energy Regen 120-140% (lower end with Midnight Veil in a Phrolova+Roccia team, higher end
with Moonlit Clouds in a Carlotta+Shorekeeper team), Havoc DMG Bonus 30-70%+.

**Skill priority**: Forte Circuit > Resonance Skill > Resonance Liberation > Basic Attack > Intro Skill
(Basic/Intro skippable to save resources at minimal damage loss).

## Gameplay and Teams

**Rotation goal** (like most Hybrids): reach 100 Concerto for her Outro as fast as possible — generate
5 Trance via Intro/Skill-or-B3/Liberation → enter Mirage via Delusive Dive → use her strongest Forte
enhanced abilities while generating 3 Shiver → consume all Shiver for Perception Drain and swap out.
**Echo usage**: most main Echo choices go at rotation's end, Swap-Cancelled, though some can be timed
situationally earlier.

**Standard Rotation**: Intro Skill: Ripple → Basic P3 → Skill: Graceful Step → Ultimate: Flowing
Suffocation → Heavy ATK: Delusive Dive → Skill: Flickering Reverie → Forte: Phantom String P1 → P2 → P3
→ Forte: Skill: Perception Drain → Echo → Outro Skill.

**Important calc note**: Sequence 3 lets her Ultimate itself initiate Mirage, allowing Delusive Dive to
be skipped entirely if desired — trimming it can push DPS higher than the S3+ figures shown below.

**Synergies**: Phrolova ("easily Phrolova's best teammate" — amplifies her Havoc + Skill DMG via Outro,
takes good field time with good damage, and a lot of her actions count as Echo Skills, granting Phrolova
3 extra Echo-Skill-triggered attacks per rotation; Cantarella's Energy-generation flaw doesn't matter to
Phrolova, who has no Resonance Energy at all — "a perfect pair"). Carlotta/Jinhsi (her substitutes for
dedicated Skill-DMG-dealer Supports — Jinhsi can also exploit her Coordinated Attacks, but her low
Energy generation drives team ER requirements way up; both cases are outclassed by Zhezhi, or even
Yinlin for Jinhsi specifically). The Shorekeeper/Verina (the two best generalist Supports by a wide
margin, slotting into almost any team with high team-wide ATK%/15% DMG Amp — Shorekeeper additionally
adds Crit Rate/Crit DMG, always a great 3rd-slot pick for Cantarella teams; Verina a close, more
accessible 2nd choice when Shorekeeper isn't available).

**Example Teams**: Team #1: Best Team, Team #2: Alternative Phrolova Teams, Team #3: Skill Damage Teams
(Cantarella on Moonlit Clouds significantly outperforms other options for easing Energy requirements
here — expect the paired DPS to need higher-than-usual ER too) — exact roster icons weren't
machine-readable in this extraction; the calc build's own explicit teammates (Phrolova + Qiuyuan) and
Synergies section corroborate these team names.

## Damage Profile (calc, solo, no team buffs)
Basic 69.1% (144,413) / Skill 9.8% (14,966) / Outro 8.3% (20,510) / Heavy 7.2% (4,884) / Echo (17,305)
/ Intro (6,775) / Liberation 0. Rotation time 7.06s. S0: 284,912 DMG (40,355 DPS).
Calc build used: weapon Whispers of Sirens (R1), Echo set Midnight Veil, main Echo Lorelei. Team buffs
applied in the calc: Phrolova + Lethean Elegy + Dream of the Lost, Havoc Eclipse + Nightmare: Hecate;
Qiuyuan + Emerald Sentence + Law of Harmony; Moonlit Clouds + Bell-Borne Geochelone.

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `cantarella.blocks.js`)

No dump file existed before this pass — created. CHAR_BUFF_TABLE, RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA (S1-S3/S6,
S4/S5 correctly zeroed as heal-only/cap-only), CHARACTER_ROTATIONS, base stats, `bestWeapon`,
`bestEchoes`, and `weaponAlts` all already matched this source exactly, and `cantarella.blocks.js`'s
TriggerBlocks engine was already extensively and carefully audited — including several deliberately-
unmodeled real mechanics (Jolt's auto-proc, the Diffusion Coordinated-ATK summon chain, S2's
currently-inert Jolt multiplier) that this pass reconfirmed as correct, not bugs.

**Real bugs found and fixed (2026-09-03)**:
1. `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['Cantarella']` was missing 4 real rows present in this source: Mid-air Attack
   (41.99%+62.99%), Dodge Counter (53.01%×4), Abysmal Vortex (the Mirage-state Mid-air replacement,
   same 41.99%+62.99% value), and Shadowy Sweep (the Mirage-state Dodge Counter replacement, 75.09%×3).
   None of the 4 are used in `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Cantarella']`, so this is a Kit-tab completeness fix
   (matching the same pattern already applied to Jinhsi's/Camellya's missing rows), not a zero-damage
   rotation bug. Added all 4.
2. `teams` named `'Cantarella + Camellya + Shorekeeper'` — this source explicitly states Camellya deals
   most of her damage via Basic Attacks (which Cantarella's Outro doesn't amplify — it amplifies Havoc
   and Skill DMG) and names Danjin, Sanhua, and Roccia as all clearly better Camellya buffers than
   Cantarella, in that order of preference. Replaced with Jinhsi — one of only two Skill-DMG-focused DPS
   this source names as an actual (if outclassed-by-Zhezhi/Yinlin) niche partner for her.
3. The DPS-tier table entry was `['Cantarella', 'T1.5', 'T0.5']` (ToA/WW) — this source's Ratings
   section (Hybrid role) states T3 (ToA) / T1.5 (WW), matched exactly by its Value Tier List. Fixed to
   `['Cantarella', 'T3', 'T1.5']`.

No test changes needed — existing `triggerEngine-cantarella.test.js` and `data-integrity.test.js`
already cover the unaffected areas. Full suite green (1335/1335).

**Full re-audit (2026-09-08, explicitly requested — including inner-kit and cross-character
interactions, not just re-checking what the extensively-documented prior passes already touched).**
Found 2 real bugs, both cross-character-interaction-relevant.

1. **Her Outro's universal Skill DMG Amp was silently Havoc-gated.** `cantarella.outro.gentle-tentacles`
   was ONE block with `condition: { element: 'havoc' }` applied at the block level, gating BOTH its
   effects — but the kit text describes two independent buffs: "+20% Havoc DMG" (genuinely
   element-specific) and "+25% Resonance Skill DMG" (no element restriction at all).
   `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Cantarella'].outroBuffs` already stores these as two SEPARATE entries, only the
   elemDmg one naming Havoc — confirming the skillDmg half should be universal, per this project's own
   `elemBuffApplies` convention (a condition that doesn't name a specific element stays universal).
   This dump's own Review section directly names Carlotta and Jinhsi (both non-Havoc) as real, if
   outclassed, partners for her specifically via this Skill DMG buff — impossible if it were secretly
   Havoc-locked. This was a real, live bug: any non-Havoc Skill-DMG carry was silently getting ZERO
   benefit from her Outro at all. Split into two blocks
   (`cantarella.outro.gentle-tentacles-havoc`/`-skill`) so only the Havoc-specific half stays
   conditioned.
2. **Delusive Dive had no damage category at all**, silently rejecting every real teammate Heavy ATK
   DMG Bonus buff — despite this dump's own Damage Profile showing a real, non-trivial "Heavy 7.2%"
   damage bucket, and `CHARACTER_DATA['Cantarella'].dmgFocus` already correctly including 'Heavy ATK'
   (this was the one block that should have satisfied it but didn't). Fixed to `category: 'heavyDmg'`
   — her kit text gives it no "considered X DMG" override.

Both fixes are cross-character-interaction-relevant (a teammate's buff correctly reaching her, or her
own buff correctly reaching a teammate) but don't change her own solo-calc numbers at all (no golden
drift, confirmed — a solo context has no teammate to receive her Outro's Skill DMG Amp, and no
teammate buffing her own Heavy ATK). Everything else re-verified clean: the extensive existing Resonance
Chain scoping (S1/S2/S3/S6, all already correctly scoped from prior passes), SKILL_MULTIPLIERS,
CHARACTER_ROTATIONS, CHAR_BUFF_TABLE, base stats, and the Diffusion cross-character summon-chain
mechanism (re-verified its own `crossCharacterHit`/`minProcInterval` design directly, not just trusted
its own comment).

Added positive-verification tests proving the Outro fix's real numeric effect on a non-Havoc ally.
Full suite green (1802/1802).
