## Kit

### Basic Attack — Reign of Silence

- **Basic Attack**: up to 2 consecutive hits, Havoc DMG. Shortly after Stage 2, press Normal Attack for **Rending Lunge**.
- **Rending Lunge**: Havoc DMG. Shortly after (ground), press Normal Attack for **Death Snip**; (mid-air) for **Hanging Finality**.
- **Death Snip**: opens the scissors (Havoc DMG), then after a delay snips (Havoc DMG + heals all nearby team members). Extra Normal Attack presses during the cast add Additional DMG and can force an early snip. **Counted as Resonance Liberation DMG.** Shortly after, press Normal Attack for **Thread Withdrawn**.
- **Thread Withdrawn**: Havoc DMG. Can trigger successful Dodges shortly after.
- **Heavy Attack**: leap + consume STA, Havoc DMG. Not castable in Chainsaw Mode. Can chain into Hanging Finality (ground follow-up or via Lifethread-Glide) or hold to chain into **Heavy Attack - Severed Facet**.
- **Mid-air Attack**: consumes STA, plunging attack, Havoc DMG. Outside Chainsaw Mode, chains into Basic Stage 2.
- **Heavy Attack - Severed Facet**: Havoc DMG. Chains into Hanging Finality; re-castable once if interrupted (hold before landing).
- **Hanging Finality**: consumes STA, plunging attack, Havoc DMG. Chains into Death Snip on landing.
- **Dodge Counter**: Havoc DMG after a successful Dodge. Chains into Rending Lunge.
- **Dodge Counter — Eye of Unraveling: Retraction**: hold Dodge after a successful ground Dodge, Havoc DMG + Stagnate. Outside Chainsaw Mode, chains into Rending Lunge (removed once Chainsaw Mode is entered); inside Chainsaw Mode, chains into Sawring - Blitz Stage 3.

### Resonance Skill — Fractured Composition

- **Eye of Unraveling**: Stagnate + Havoc DMG. Outside Chainsaw Mode, chains into Rending Lunge (removed on entering Chainsaw Mode). In Chainsaw Mode (ground), chains into Sawring - Blitz Stage 2. Castable mid-air.
- **Serrated Loop**: replaces Skill on the ground once Ring of Chainsaw is full — Stagnate + Havoc DMG + pulls in targets, enters **Chainsaw Mode** (Skill becomes Eye of Unraveling). Chains into Sawring - Blitz Stage 2; holding continuously attacks/pulls, then releases or auto-continues into Sawring - Blitz Stage 1.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Eye of Unraveling | 35.79% |
| Serrated Loop | 17.45%×8 |
| Serrated Loop (hold) | 7.46%×16 |
| Eye of Unraveling cooldown | 12s |

### Resonance Liberation — Moment of Nihility

- Havoc DMG + heals all nearby team members. Enters **Woven Myriad - Convergence** for 15s. Outside Chainsaw Mode, shortly after, chains into Basic Stage 2. Castable mid-air near ground.
- **Woven Myriad - Convergence**: +120% DMG Multiplier to Sawring - Blitz, Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter, and Sawring - Eradication; the Ring-of-Chainsaw-consumption bonus DMG Multiplier for Sawring - Eradication (granted by Blitz/Dodge Counter) gets a further +120%. Ends when Sawring - Eradication is cast.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Skill DMG | 954.29% |
| Healing | 2660 + 117.60% ATK |
| Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Energy cost | 125 |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Forte Circuit — Sight of Unraveling: Oblivion

- **Unseen Snare**: inflicted on a target for 30s via Skill hit, hitting shortly after Serrated Loop, Dodge Counter - Eye of Unraveling: Retraction hit, or simply locking onto a target. Targets with Unseen Snare taking direct team damage get 1 stack of **Havoc Bane** (once per 2s).
- **Thread of Bane**: dealing damage to Unseen Snare targets ignores 18% of their DEF.
- **Chainsaw Mode**: unlocks Sawring - Blitz, Sawring - Eradication, Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter. Blitz and Dodge Counter consume Ring of Chainsaw on hit.
  - **Sawring - Blitz**: up to 3-stage chain, Havoc DMG, **counted as Resonance Liberation DMG**. Stage 2 can be held for continuous hits, auto-releases into Stage 2: Discordance, chains into Stage 3 (also holdable for continuous hits), auto-follows into Sawring - Eradication or releases into Stage 3: Falltone.
  - **Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter**: after a successful Dodge in Chainsaw Mode, Havoc DMG, **counted as Resonance Liberation DMG**. Chains into Sawring - Blitz Stage 3 (or Stage 2: Discordance on release/no-directional Dodge); holdable for sustained attacks.
  - **Sawring - Eradication**: cast after Stage 3: Falltone or after consuming all Ring of Chainsaw — Havoc DMG + Shields the whole nearby team for 30s. **Counted as Resonance Liberation DMG.** Every 1 point of Ring of Chainsaw consumed by Blitz/Dodge Counter (up to 100) raises its DMG Multiplier. Consumes all remaining Ring of Chainsaw and ends Chainsaw Mode.
  - **Chainsaw Fever** (replaces Lifethread - Jetstream in Chainsaw Mode, starts at 100%): depletes without dealing damage for a while; at 0, enters Burnout State and exits Chainsaw Mode. Resets on dealing damage or casting Liberation/Intro/Falltone.
- **Lifethread - Glide**: outside Chainsaw Mode with 10+ Lifethread - Jetstream, consumes 50 points via 5 different triggers (post-Heavy Attack dodge, post-Skill dodge, post-Thread Withdrawn dodge, launched-airborne dodge, chained Glide dodge) — pulls in Unseen Snare targets, holdable to glide, can trigger Dodges shortly after.
- **Ring of Chainsaw** (cap 100): gained from Normal Attack/Eye of Unraveling hits; +40 from Liberation cast; +20 from Intro cast.
- **Lifethread - Jetstream** (cap 100): regenerates over time; +100 on defeating a target; resets to max on exiting Chainsaw Mode; paused briefly after Lifethread - Glide.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 1 | 11.49%×6 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 2 | 10.64%×8 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 2 (hold) | 10.64%×10 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 2: Discordance | 3.58%×3 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 3 | 15.98%×8 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 3 (hold) | 15.98%×6 |
| Sawring - Blitz Stage 3: Falltone | 3.58%×3 |
| Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter | 10.64%×8 |
| Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter (hold) | 10.64%×10 |
| Sawring - Eradication | 51.54%+206.13% |
| Bonus DMG Multiplier per Ring of Chainsaw | 2.59% |
| Sawring - Eradication Shield | 3800 + 168.00% ATK |
| Sawring - Eradication Concerto Regen | 45 |

### Inherent Skills

- **Inescapable Fate**: a team member defeating an Unseen Snare target resets Eye of Unraveling's cooldown (once per 3s).
- **All Ends Here**: casting Intro or Liberation grants +20% Havoc DMG Bonus and +20% Healing Bonus for 12s. Team members with Thread of Bane defeating an Unseen Snare target grant Chisa **Sight of Unraveling** for 3s — while active, Chisa inflicts a fresh 30s Unseen Snare on any target damaged by a Thread-of-Bane team member.

### Intro Skill — Reverberance - Return

- Attack, Havoc DMG. Outside Chainsaw Mode, shortly after, chains into Basic Stage 2; in Chainsaw Mode, chains into Sawring - Blitz Stage 2.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Skill DMG | 95.43% |
| Concerto Regen | 10 |

### Outro Skill — Unraveling - Law Zero

- Grants **Resonant Thread of Closure** to all nearby team members for 20s: attacks landed raise the target's max Negative Status/Electro Rage stack cap by 3 for 15s (unstackable); inflicting a Negative Status or dealing Negative Status DMG grants **Thread of Bane** for 15s.

### Resonance Chain (Sequences)

- **S1**: Interruption immunity during Sawring - Blitz, Sawring - Eradication, Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter. Inflicting Unseen Snare additionally: +30% ATK for 15s; deals a fixed 61,803 Havoc DMG (caps target HP loss at 61.80%, once per target, **counted as Basic Attack DMG with no damage-bonus interaction**).
- **S2**: Ignores 10% target Havoc RES. Nearby team members with Thread of Bane gain +50% All-Attribute DMG Bonus.
- **S3**: Sawring - Blitz/Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter/Sawring - Eradication DMG Multipliers +120% (stacks with Woven Myriad - Convergence's own +120%). The Ring-of-Chainsaw consumption bonus for Sawring - Eradication gets a further +120% (also stacks with Convergence's). Vibration Strength Reduction Rate of those 3 moves +50%.
- **S4**: Unseen Snare's Havoc Bane proc changes from once/2s to **once/1s**.
- **S5**: Liberation (Moment of Nihility) DMG Bonus +100%. Lifethread - Glide costs 50% less Jetstream.
- **S6**: Surviving a fatal hit during Sawring - Blitz/Eradication/Chainsaw Dodge Counter at 1 HP. Unseen Snare becomes **Unseen Snare - Finality**: keeps all base effects, +30% Amplified DMG from Negative Statuses, +40% increased DMG from Chisa specifically.

### Minor Fortes
Crit Rate +8%, ATK% +12%.

### Base Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 10775 · ATK 438 · DEF 1137 · Max Energy 125 · Crit Rate 5% · Crit DMG 150%

## Review

**DPS tier**: **T0** (Tower of Adversity + Whimpering Wastes, standard) / **T0** (Tower of Adversity, Value) / **T0.5** (Whimpering Wastes, Value) — labeled **Support**.

**Pros**
- Top-tier Support for a large share of the meta — Negative Status archetype is extremely prominent.
- Extremely quickswap-friendly, lots of animations that let her personal damage be used without the usual long-rotation cost.
- Grouping, healing, shielding — facilitates use.
- Unique DEF Shred/DEF Ignore form of DMG increase, works for all damage types including Negative Status.

**Cons**
- Needs her Signature weapon to stand out from Aero Rover in the Cartethyia team.
- Most buffs are Negative-Status-gated (weak in multi-wave content) or only function on Negative Status appliers (Signature) / damage dealers (DEF Ignore) — restricts her use-case entirely to Negative Status teams.
- Long rotation for a Support, doesn't justify her personal damage even at the higher end for Supports (negated in Quickswap though).

**Key mechanics**
- **Unseen Snare**: lets her apply Havoc Bane every 2s, and lets Thread-of-Bane allies ignore 18% of the afflicted enemy's DEF.
- **Havoc Bane**: up to 12% DEF Shred at 6 stacks (applied by Chisa every 2s while Unseen Snare is up).
- **Thread of Bane**: +18% DEF Ignore to whoever personally applies a Negative Status or deals Negative Status damage — nothing for anyone who doesn't.
- **Signature (Kumokiri)**: +24% general DMG Bonus to whoever personally inflicts a Negative Status — nothing otherwise.
- **Outro**: raises the max stack cap of any Negative Status/Electro Rage by 3 on hit.
- All these buffs can be permanently up in a ≤30s rotation (standard viable rotations run ~25-28s) provided the recipient can personally fulfill the activation condition — buffs do NOT apply to characters who can't trigger their own Negative Status. This makes Chisa's kit non-functional in non-Negative-Status teams (even free options like Baizhi beat her there).
- DEF Ignore (18%, character-applied) and DEF Shred (12% max, enemy-applied) are separate multiplicative DEF-reduction terms — her totals (18%/12%) are actually less efficient than a hypothetical flat 30% of either, but her unique ability to affect direct Negative Status tick damage (Frazzle/Erosion) makes her especially strong alongside direct Negative-Status damage dealers.
- Forte gauge "Ring of Chainsaw" is the core of her rotation — filling it unlocks enhanced Chainsaw Basic Attacks, ending in Eradication (rotation-ending swap-cancel point). Simplest execution: tap Basic Attack through the Chainsaw state and Swap Cancel the last hit.
- Unused in her rotation: base Skill (outside the Opener — too little Forte/Energy for the cast time), Mid-air Attacks, Heavy Attacks, and her secondary Forte resource Jetstream.

**Meta position**: settled well into the meta — Negative Status is only growing (Glacio Chafe, Fusion Burst synergies). Contested/weaker in the Cartethyia team without her Signature (needed to beat Aero Rover there); slightly reduced value in Whimpering Wastes (enemies often die before Havoc Bane fully ramps, unlike synergy-agnostic Supports like Aero Rover). Worse than alternatives in Spectro Frazzle 3rd-slot (Shorekeeper/Spectro Rover with Zani+Phoebe; Lynae with Absolution Phoebe outside quickswap). Strong across Yangyang: Xuanling (highest ceiling), Aemeath+Denia Fusion Burst (very close 2nd), Cartethyia, Hiyuki Glacio Chafe, and a fallback Phoebe team.

## Build

### Best Weapons (buffs assumed: Aemeath + Everbright Polestar + Trailblazing Star + Sigillum, Denia + Forged Dwarf Star + Chromatic Foam + Reminiscence: Denia)
| Weapon | Score |
|---|---|
| Kumokiri (R1, signature) | 100.00% |
| Wildfire Mark (R1) | 88.40% |
| Ages of Harvest (R1) | 82.10% |
| Verdant Summit (R1) | 81.50% |
| Radiance Cleaver (R1) | 80.00% |
| Thunderflare Dominion (R1) | 78.80% |
| Lustrous Razor (R1) | 75.40% |
| Autumntrace (R5, 4★, Battle Pass) | 69.80% |
| Meditations on Mercy (R5, 4★, No-Gacha/craftable) | 69.00% |

**Signature (Kumokiri)**: +12% ATK; casting Intro or inflicting Negative Statuses grants +8% Liberation DMG Bonus (stacks ×3, 15s); at max stacks, team members inflicting Negative Statuses gain +24% All-Attribute DMG Bonus for 15s (doesn't work with Zani, works with all other Negative Status characters including Chisa herself). Naturally her best choice — fully exploits her kit, and extends the 24% DMG Bonus to other Negative Status appliers on the team.
**Radiance Cleaver**: strongest permanently-available option (simple ATK/Crit DMG stat-stick, barely benefits from its own Skill-DMG passive).
**Meditations on Mercy**: best No-Gacha option (craftable).

### Best Echo Sets

**1) Rejuvenating Glow** (100%) — 2pc: +10% Healing. 5pc: healing allies grants the whole team +15% ATK for 30s. Best overall set except in non-ATK-scaling teams (e.g. Cartethyia) — near-permanent team-wide ATK buff since Chisa's Liberation heals easily. Main Echo: **Fallacy of No Return** — simple Summon, +10% team ATK for 20s + 10% Energy Regen to the wielder, castable any time (ideally right before Outro).

**2) Thread of Severed Fate** — 3pc: inflicting Havoc Bane grants +20% ATK and +30% Liberation DMG Bonus for 5s. Best set for Chisa's own personal damage — she applies Havoc Bane constantly and deals mostly Liberation-type DMG.
Pair with (2pc): Havoc Eclipse / **Midnight Veil (recommended)** / Endless Resonance (2pc) / Reel of Spliced Memories / Moonlit Clouds (2pc) / Empyrean Anthem (2pc) / Tidebreaking Courage.
Main Echo: **Reminiscence: Threnodian - Leviathan** — +12% Havoc DMG and +12% Liberation DMG Bonus in main slot (her 2 damage types), plus decent cast-over-time damage (boosted by Havoc Bane on target) — ideally animation-cancelled via her Ultimate.

**Best Echo Stats**: 4-cost Crit Rate/Crit DMG · 3-cost Havoc DMG · 3-cost Havoc DMG ≥ ATK% · 1-cost ATK% ×2.
**Substat priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > Liberation DMG% > ATK.
Note: Havoc DMG is significantly stronger than ATK% as a main-stat on Rejuvenating Glow; roughly equal on Thread of Severed Fate.

### Endgame Stat Targets (Lv.90)
HP 15000+ · DEF 1100+ · ATK 2000–2500+ · Crit Rate 65–80%+ · Crit DMG 210–255%+ · Energy Regen 125%+ · Havoc DMG Bonus 40–70%+.

### Skill Priority
Forte Circuit > Resonance Liberation > Basic Attack > Resonance Skill > Intro Skill (Skill and Intro skippable at minimal loss).

## Gameplay & Teams

### Opener Rotation (no Intro available)
Basic 1 → Basic 2 (cancel via Skill) → Skill: Eye of Unraveling → Basic: Rending Lunge → Basic: Death Snip (full) → Basic: Thread Withdrawn (cancel via Ultimate) → Ultimate → Basic 2 (cancel via Skill) → Skill: Serrated Loop → Basic: Sawring Blitz 2 → Basic: Sawring Blitz 3 → Basic: Eradication (swap) → Outro.

### Loop Rotation (Intro available)
Intro → Basic 2 → Basic: Rending Lunge → Basic: Death Snip (partial animation interruption via Ultimate) → Ultimate → Skill: Serrated Loop → Basic: Sawring Blitz 2 → Basic: Sawring Blitz 3 → Basic: Eradication (swap) → Outro.

Death Snip's partial interruption: happens after she finishes stepping back (before dashing toward the enemy) — 2 of 3 hits land, the last hit and Additional Multipliers are skipped, speeding up the rotation using Eradication's leftover Concerto.

Echo timing: on Thread of Severed Fate, cast right before Ultimate to cancel its animation; on Rejuvenating Glow, cast right before Outro to maximize the 2-other-teammate uptime.

Swap Cancel windows (beyond Eradication): any non-Sawring-Blitz Basic Attack after the 2nd + Skill: Serrated Loop (optional, to manage other characters); Sawring Blitz Basic 3 (short window, used in advanced quickswap). Negative Status Amplification Outros (Ciaccona's, Denia's) don't expire on swap, giving her rotation freedom to pre-charge Forte before her own Intro.

### Synergies

**Yangyang: Xuanling / Aemeath / Hiyuki / Cartethyia / Phoebe** — Chisa is best buffing Negative Status main damage dealers (her Outro/Weapon buffs require the recipient to apply their own Negative Status). By current strength: Yangyang: Xuanling (highest ceiling), Aemeath (very close, full Fusion Burst team with Denia), Cartethyia and Hiyuki (also excellent, close when fully optimized), Phoebe (fine fallback).

### Example Teams
- **Best Team**: Yangyang: Xuanling + Suisui + Lynae / Rebecca + Phrolova + Chisa. Chisa on Moonlit Clouds in 2nd slot with Suisui for optimal buffing, else Rejuvenating Glow 3rd-slot Support.
- **Aemeath Fusion Burst Team**: Aemeath + Denia + Chisa.
- **Hiyuki Team**: Hiyuki + Lynae + Chisa.
- **Cartethyia Team**: Cartethyia + Ciaccona + Rover (Aero) / Chisa — only stronger than Aero Rover in 3rd slot with her Signature; use Skyfall Severance to convert Havoc Bane into Erosion alongside Chisa.
- **Phoebe Expert Team**: Phoebe + Rover (Spectro) + Ciaccona / Chisa — only worthwhile with heavy investment + quickswap, otherwise outshined by Lynae/Phrolova; not generally recommended.

## Calculations

### Real Damage-Type Breakdown (the guide's own simulated rotation, S0, solo/no buffs)
| Type | DMG | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Basic ATK | 6,168 | (small) |
| Heavy ATK | 9,764 | (small) |
| **Skill** | 9,254 | shown as **1/3** slice label |
| **Liberation** | 192,455 | **84.5%** (largest wedge) |
| Intro | 5,918 | (small) |
| Outro | 0 | 0% |
| Echo | 4,211 | (small) |

Note: page's pie chart highlights Basic/Heavy/Skill as the labeled small slices (1/3 = one of several minor-share labels shown) with Liberation dominant at 84.5% — matches her kit exactly: Death Snip, Sawring - Blitz, Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter, and Sawring - Eradication are all explicitly "considered Resonance Liberation DMG," meaning nearly all of her Chainsaw-state damage (her rotation's core) is Liberation-categorized despite being Basic-Attack-input-driven.

### Damage Output by Sequence (S0→S6, 1-target, solo — no team/buff contribution)
Rotation time: 7.21s. Build: Kumokiri R1, 3pc Thread of Severed Fate + 2pc Endless Resonance, Fallacy of No Return main echo (Crit DMG / Havoc DMG / Havoc DMG / ATK / ATK).

| Sequence | DMG | DPS | Relative % |
|---|---|---|---|
| S0 | 229,467 | 31,826 | 100.00% |
| S1 | 271,662 | 37,678 | 118.39% |
| S2 | 366,520 | 50,835 | 159.73% |
| S3 | 463,940 | 64,347 | 202.18% |
| S4 | 463,940 | 64,347 | 202.18% |
| S5 | 500,448 | 69,410 | 218.09% |
| S6 | 642,753 | 89,147 | 280.11% |

Note S3 and S4 produce byte-identical DMG/DPS — same "zeroed" pattern already seen on other characters whose S4 node has no real DPS component (here, S4's Unseen Snare Havoc Bane proc-rate change from 2s→1s doesn't register in a fixed-length solo calc rotation).

## Full re-audit (2026-09-08)

Full re-read of this dump, `chisa.blocks.js` (already through a Phase A audit and 2 completeness
passes), and every relevant `characters.js` table (CHAR_BUFF_TABLE, RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA,
SKILL_MULTIPLIERS, CHARACTER_ROTATIONS, CHARACTER_DATA). Three real findings, the first a major gap:

1. **Woven Myriad - Convergence — Liberation's own BASE-KIT effect (unconditional, active at every
   sequence level, NOT chain-gated) — was entirely unmodeled.** `chisa.liberation.moment-of-nihility`'s
   own note previously said Convergence had "no DPS component," but the dump's own Liberation section
   is explicit: "+120% DMG Multiplier to Sawring - Blitz, Chainsaw Mode - Dodge Counter, and
   Sawring - Eradication; the Ring-of-Chainsaw-consumption bonus DMG Multiplier for Sawring -
   Eradication [...] gets a further +120%." Only `chain.s3` (a SEPARATE, chain-gated DUPLICATE of the
   exact same two bonuses — its own note already confirmed it "stacks with Woven Myriad -
   Convergence's own +120%") was ever modeled — meaning every sequence level, not just below S3, was
   silently missing this entire base-kit multiplier on her single largest damage category (Liberation
   is 84.5% of her real rotation per the dump's own damage-type breakdown). Added a new block,
   `chisa.selfbuff.woven-myriad-convergence`, scoped to the 2 real modeled moves it covers.
2. **`chain.s3`'s own libDmg:120 was UNSCOPED.** libDmg is category-gated, but that only means it
   reaches every libDmg-categorized block — not just the 3 moves S3's kit text actually names. Left
   unscoped, it was ALSO silently boosting `chisa.basic.death-snip` and the base
   `chisa.liberation.moment-of-nihility` hit itself, neither of which S3's kit text covers. Rescoped to
   the 2 real modeled moves via `scopedToBlockId`.
3. **`chain.s3`'s own 2nd effect (a further +120% to the Ring-of-Chainsaw consumption bonus
   specifically) was left entirely unmodeled**, with the file's prior note only explaining it was
   "left unmodeled, same as S2's own split" — but by the time of this pass, a real block
   (`chisa.forte.sawring-eradication-ring-scalar`) already existed specifically to scope this onto.
   Added as a scoped `totalMult` effect, mirroring Convergence's own identical 2nd effect above.
4. **`chain.s6`'s own "+40% increased DMG from Chisa specifically" was entirely missing** — the audit
   comment backing `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Chisa'].s6` only ever named the +30% team-wide amplify half
   of the same kit-text sentence. Added as an unscoped `elemDmg:40` effect (unscoped is correct here,
   unlike Cartethyia's own analogous chain.s6 fix earlier this session — this file only contains
   Chisa's own kit, with no "different form" carve-out needed).

`RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Chisa']` updated to store both of S3's real values (`libDmg:120,
totalMult:120`) and both of S6's (`amplify:30, elemDmg:40`), matching the existing 2-value convention
already used for S2's own allDmg/resShred split. Golden-parity fixture re-measured (legacy
3264→4953, engine 4084→5773, both driven by the Convergence fix since RAW tier shares the modern
block-based resolver); new ratio ~1.166 stays inside the existing `EXPECTED_DIVERGENCES` band
(1.15–1.35), documented with a dated comment.

Everything else re-verified clean against this dump with no changes needed: S1/S2/S4/S5 (S4 correctly
zeroed as pure utility), Thread of Bane/Havoc Bane, Minor Fortes, both Inherent Skills, the Intro/
Liberation self-buff split, Death Snip/Rending Lunge/Sawring-Blitz's own categorization, base stats
(10,775/438/1,137/125), DPS tier (T0/T0), bestWeapon (Kumokiri), weaponAlts, bestEchoes, full
SKILL_MULTIPLIERS, and CHARACTER_ROTATIONS all match this dump exactly. Full test suite: 1814/1814
passing (5 new/updated tests).
