### Resonance Skill — Protocol Breach

**Payload**: charge forward, Spectro DMG, inflicts Hack - Shifting. On hit, automatic follow-up attack
(Spectro DMG), activates Pulse Interference. No target hit during charge → -70% CD; interrupted/failed
cast → no CD reduction. Press after follow-up → Basic Stage 2. Hold after follow-up lands → Heavy
Stage 2.
**Pulse Interference**: cut through target, Spectro DMG, briefly Stagnates, grants Digital Handshake
(passive TCP/s while on-field and not in Algorithm Compaction, removed at 100 TCP or on Liberation
cast). Press after → Basic Stage 2.
**Deadlock** (replaces Payload/Pulse Interference at 100 TCP or in Algorithm Compaction): attack
target, Spectro DMG, inflicts Hack - Shifting, considered Heavy Attack DMG. Press after → Thread
Shredding Stage 2. CD resets on Liberation cast.

| | |
|---|---|
| Payload Charge DMG | 20.05%+10.03% |
| Payload Follow-Up Attack DMG | 40.09%+10.03%+20.05% |
| Pulse Interference DMG | 30.86%×2+61.72%×3+61.72% |
| Deadlock DMG | 51.70%+206.77% |
| Payload Cooldown | 15s |
| Deadlock Cooldown | 14s |

### Resonance Liberation — Netrunner
Deep dives into cyberspace, 10s Protocol Interface: choose up to 7 Spoofing Programs (24 starting RAM).
Marks targets in view; all selected programs apply to marked targets. Override triggers on duration
expiry or holding Normal Attack — Spectro DMG to all marked targets, considered Heavy Attack DMG, closes
interface.

**Spoofing Programs**: Ping (2 RAM, extends view, marks+damages nearby, Heavy ATK DMG), Cyberware
Malfunction (4 RAM, +5% DMG taken/30s), Breach Protocol (4 RAM, -5% DEF/30s), Synapse Burnout (5 RAM,
damage, Heavy ATK DMG), Cripple Movement (6 RAM, Hack DMG + -5% ATK/30s), Weapon Glitch (5 RAM, chance
to nullify attacks/30s), Cyberpsychosis (6 RAM, converts Common Class to neutral).

**Old Net Deep Dive** (replaces Netrunner after Multi-threading in Algorithm Compaction): all Netrunner
effects + greatly increased Override DMG Multiplier. Reverts to Netrunner after cast or on exiting
Algorithm Compaction. Castable mid-air near ground.

| | |
|---|---|
| Netrunner: Override DMG | 894.65% |
| Ping DMG | 79.53% |
| Synapse Burnout DMG | 79.53% |
| Cripple Movement DMG | 911.83% Tune AMP |
| Old Net Deep Dive: Override DMG | 1789.29% |
| Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Cost | 125 |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Resonance Chain (Dupes)
- **S1**: Immune to interruption while casting Payload/Pulse Interference/Dual Threading/Multi-threading.
  Casting Intro grants +20% ATK for 14s. Killing a Spoofing Program-affected target with a teammate's
  direct damage records that effect and grants the killer a matching Quick Action for 6s.
- **S2**: While casting Netrunner/Old Net Deep Dive, starting RAM → 32. After Pulse Interference, 1
  additional 450%-ATK Spectro DMG instance (considered Heavy Attack DMG), applies all continuous
  Spoofing Program status effects. Forte enhanced: Multi-threading's SQL bonus 270%→560%.
- **S3**: Override DMG Multiplier +50%, Crit DMG +100% (both Netrunner/Old Net Deep Dive). Cripple
  Movement DMG +65%. Data Crash DMG +65%.
- **S4**: Team inflicting Hack - Shifting grants the whole team +20% all-Attribute DMG Bonus for 20s.
- **S5**: Optical Illusion (Inherent Skill 1) stack cap 1→2. Enhanced: below 50% HP, auto-gain 1 stack
  on hit (180s CD), grants a Shield = 150% ATK for 10s when triggered. Purely defensive, no DMG
  Multiplier.
- **S6**: Hack-Shifting/Interfered targets take +40% increased Heavy Attack DMG and +60% increased Hack
  DMG from Lucy. Data Crash's Stagnate extended to 1.5s.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Crit Rate +8%, ATK% +12%.

### Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 11025 / ATK 425 / DEF 1149 / Max Energy 150 / Crit Rate 5% / Crit DMG 150% / Spectro DMG 0%.

### Forte Circuit — Depths of Blackwall

**Cloud Portal**: outside Algorithm Compaction, gains TCP on hit; at 100 TCP, Skill → Deadlock.
Netrunner/Old Net Deep Dive cast clears all TCP.

**Algorithm Compaction**: after Deadlock, enters state + 1 SQL stack. Basic → Thread Shredding, Heavy →
Single Threading. +65% Spectro DMG Bonus for 8s (once per entry — re-casting Deadlock in-state doesn't
re-grant SQL/DMG Bonus). Gains Root Access on Thread Shredding/Single Threading hits; at 100 Root
Access, Single Threading → Dual Threading (chains into Multi-threading). Multi-threading: with SQL,
+270% DMG Multiplier (removes SQL); without SQL, -20% current HP (no cost if HP<1%). After
Multi-threading, Netrunner → Old Net Deep Dive. Exits state after casting Liberation, or after 8s of no
attacks post-Multi-threading.

**Hack Response — Data Crash**: deals Spectro DMG to a Hack-Interfered target, applies Data Crash
(Stagnate 0.5s after target's next hit), considered Hack DMG.

**TCP** (cap 100): gained via Basic/Heavy/Mid-air/Dodge Counter/Payload/Pulse Interference hits. Intro
cast → next Pulse Interference grants +20 TCP.

**Root Access** (cap 100): gained via Thread Shredding/Single Threading/Dual Threading/Multi-Threading/
Mid-air Algorithm Compaction/Dodge Counter Algorithm Compaction hits.

| | |
|---|---|
| Hack Response - Data Crash | 1094.19%+68.39%×4 Tune AMP |

### Inherent Skills
- **Ghost Cyberware**: if the active Lucy takes no damage for 8s, gains 1 stack of Optical Illusion
  (cap 1 base). Optical Illusion: reduces next instance of DMG by 100%; if hit/launched, immediately
  recovers and triggers a successful Dodge if grounded; consumes the stack.
- **Function Cracking**: Payload/Pulse Interference/Deadlock hitting an Overlord/Calamity Class enemy
  applies a 2-min Botnet Mark; a teammate's direct-damage kill on that target grants Lucy (and
  Rebecca, if present) Network Backdoor: +10% All DMG Amp + 10% Hack DMG Multiplier, 2 min, stacks
  ×2 (resets duration on refresh); at 2 stacks, additionally +5%/+5%. Invalid while Lucy is downed.

### Intro Skill — Outdated Hallucination
Attack target, Spectro DMG. Grants team wallhack vision for 25s (enhanced on Rebecca; activates her
turret's Overload for 4s if deployed). Next Pulse Interference grants +20 TCP. Multiplier: 69.14%+69.14%.

### Outro Skill — Countermeasure Program
Incoming Resonator: +25% Basic ATK DMG Amp for 14s or until swapped out. Team-wide Countermeasure
Program for 25s: any other active Resonator inflicting Hack - Shifting gains +20% All DMG Amp (self);
any other team Resonator attacked grants them 30% DMG Reduction (3s) + Stagnates their attacker (1s),
once per Countermeasure Program instance (refreshes on re-trigger). All-DMG-Amp benefit ends early on
swap.

## Review

- DPS Tier: T1 (Tower of Adversity), T2 (Whimpering Wastes). Value Tier: T0.5 / T2.
- **Pros**: accessible (free best-in-slot buffer Rebecca + generalist Support options, none
  Signature-dependent); high Sequence value (S1 big for Whimpering Wastes, S2-S3 extend longevity).
- **Cons**: lower damage ceiling than every modern release before her (roughly late-2.x tier); fairly
  Signature-dependent to hit a standard modern level; 2nd Inherent Skill rarely triggers outside niche
  scenarios (early Matrix rounds, Tower 2-4); Hack is exclusive to collab characters and can't benefit
  from standard endgame Tune Rupture buffs; collab character, unlikely to ever rerun.
- Core mechanic: build TCP → cast enhanced Skill (Deadlock) → build Root Access via Algorithm
  Compaction Basic Attacks → Dual Threading (full Root Access) → Multi-threading → enhanced Ultimate →
  swap out.
- Ultimate freezes time, lets you pick 7 Spoofing Programs (damage/debuffs); until S2, only the first 5
  are worth picking.
- Hack = functionally identical to Tune Rupture (same multiplier math, different name). Applies Hack -
  Shifting via various attacks; casting a Tune Break Skill on a Shifting target triggers Data Crash.
- Rotation: Intro → Skill 1&2 (Payload/Pulse Interference, regenerate TCP passively + activate
  Signature passives) → 3 Basic Attacks → enhanced Skill (Deadlock) → full Basic Attack chain (restores
  Root Access) → Forte Heavy Attack → Ultimate → swap. No other attacks useful; dodging costs rotation
  time, so she's prone to interruption.
- Passives only marginally help consistency; Inherent Skill 2's mark debuff is niche (early Matrix,
  Tower 2-4).
- Meta position: significantly outperformed by Aemeath/Luuk/Sigrika/Hiyuki; ceiling comparable to
  Augusta/Phrolova even in her best team. Easy to build (free buffer + generalist supports) but
  forgettable for meta-only players; fine pick for Cyberpunk: Edgerunners fans.

## Build

**Best Weapon**: Spectral Trigger (R1, signature) — ATK+12%, Skill cast → +20% Spectro DMG (14s,
stacks ×2); Hack-Shifting → +30% Heavy ATK DMG Amp (14s) + Heavy ATK ignores 10% DEF during that
window. 100%. Alts: Lux & Umbra 88.4% (Galbrena's signature, strong alt), Skull Thrasher 83.5%
(Rebecca's signature, situational), Phasic Homogenizer 79.3%, The Last Dance 79.2%, Spectrum Blaster
78.0%, Static Mist 76.7%, Woodland Aria 74.4%, Solar Flame 67.5% (best 4★), Relativistic Jet 64.6%,
Pistols#26 (best F2P).

**Best Echo Set**: Shadow of Shattered Dreams (1pc) — Hack-Shifting → +35% Basic + Heavy ATK DMG Bonus
for 15s. Paired with 2pc Rite of Gilded Revelation/Pact of Neonlight Leap/Eternal Radiance/Celestial
Light (recommended), or 2pc Endless Resonance/Reel of Spliced Memories, or 2pc Moonlit
Clouds/Empyrean Anthem/Tidebreaking Courage. Main Echo: Reminiscence - Nightmare: Adam Smasher (+15%
Crit Rate to Lucy/Rebecca in main slot).

**Substats priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > Heavy DMG% > ATK.

**Endgame stat targets (Lv.90)**: HP 15500+, DEF 1100+, ATK 2100-2200+, Crit Rate 65%+ (before Adam
Smasher), Crit DMG 210%+, Energy Regen 125% (121% workable with Mornye), Spectro DMG Bonus 40-70%+.

**Skill priority**: Liberation > Basic Attack > Forte Circuit > Skill > Intro.

## Gameplay and Teams

**Opener "Rotation"**: Ultimate (first 5 Programs) → swap, cast immediately at fight start since her
best teams take 25+s to cycle back to her.

**Loop Rotation**: Intro → Skill: Payload → Skill: Pulse Interference → Basic 2 → Basic 3 → Basic 4
(cancel endlag via Skill) → Skill: Deadlock → Basic: Thread 1 → Thread 2 → Thread 3 → Thread 4 → Heavy:
Dual-threading → Heavy: Multi-threading (cancel endlag via Ultimate) → Ultimate (first 5 Programs) →
Outro.

**Tip**: summon her Echo (Adam Smasher) at any point in the rotation.

**Synergies**: Rebecca (by far her best partner — kits are mutually named/tied, unique Hack synergy, no
alternative comes close). 3rd slot: Mornye (best — maximizes Hack via Off-Tune Buildup Rate), Shorekeeper
(very close 2nd via Crit buffs, better in Whimpering Wastes since off-tuning the same enemy repeatedly
is rare there), Verina (generalist fallback, weaker but capable).

**Example Teams**: Best Team — Lucy + Rebecca + Mornye/Shorekeeper (Shorekeeper may edge out in
Whimpering Wastes for the reason above).

## Damage Profile (calc, solo, no team buffs)
Heavy 76.8% (948,725) / Hack 12.3% (152,527) / Basic 3.9% (47,753) / Skill (27,654) / Echo (42,330) /
Intro (16,599) / Liberation 0 / Outro 0. Rotation time 11.83s. S0: 1,235,587 DMG (104,445 DPS).

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `lucy.blocks.js`)

No dump file existed before this pass — created. This was the first time a full, unblocked .mht
snapshot was available for Lucy (prior audits explicitly noted the exact per-move Multipliers tables
"render client-side... not exposed in text extraction"), so several previously-undiscoverable gaps
resolved this pass.

**Real bugs found and fixed**:
1. `tuneBreak.ruptureDmgMult` for Hack Response - Data Crash was previously blank/unconfirmed ("exact
   ruptureDmgMult... not exposed in text extraction") — now sourced: 1094.19%+68.39%×4 = 1367.75.
2. `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['Lucy']`'s Basic Attack Stage 1 segment was `12.15%×6+48.59%` — a fabricated ×6
   repeat (real value is a single 12.15% hit) — corrected.
3. The `'Payload / Pulse Interference / Deadlock'` combined row's Payload segment was truncated with
   a literal `"..."` in the stored string, documented as "a lower bound, not a fabricated completion"
   — now the full sourced value (Charge 20.05%+10.03% + Follow-Up 40.09%+10.03%+20.05%), wired into
   `lucy.skill.payload`.
4. `Basic ATK: Thread Shredding Stage 1-4` and `Heavy ATK: Dual Threading` — 2 real `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`
   steps with NO matching `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS` row at all (silently 0 DMG, both flagged in
   `data-integrity.test.js`'s `KNOWN_UNRESOLVED_BASELINE` and `lucy.blocks.js`'s own "not modeled
   rather than guessed" comment) — now added with real sourced values and wired as new engine blocks
   (`lucy.basic.thread-shredding-stage1-4`, `lucy.heavy.dual-threading`). This resolves a real,
   meaningful DPS undercount in her actual burst rotation.
5. `chain.s1` was modeled as an unconditional passive +20% ATK — the kit text is explicit this only
   applies for 14s after casting Intro. Converted to a real cast-scoped 14s buffWindow.
6. `chain.s2` and `chain.s3` were BOTH `kind:'buff', trigger:{type:'cast',...}, timing:{}` — the same
   dead cast-scoped/no-duration no-op shape as Carlotta's S1/S2 and Galbrena's S3 (Engine
   development.md item 12, now 6th/7th confirmed instances) — fixed via `trigger:{type:'passive'}` +
   `scopedToBlockId`.
7. `chain.s3`'s `libDmg:50` effect was ALSO independently a category-gating no-op: its target block
   (`lucy.liberation.old-net-deep-dive`) is `category:'heavyDmg'`, not `'libDmg'` — fixed to
   `heavyDmg` (same double-bug shape as Galbrena's S3).
8. `chain.s4`'s duration was 25 — conflated with the Outro's own separate 25s Countermeasure Program
   window. S4's own kit text says "for 20s" — fixed.
9. `chain.s5` (`totalMult:5`) had NO textual basis at all — the real S5 text is 100% defensive
   (Optical Illusion stack cap, HP-triggered Shield), no DMG Multiplier mentioned anywhere. Zeroed in
   both `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA` and the engine block, matching the established "invented number with
   no basis" removal precedent (Augusta's S5).

**Found, NOT fixed (schema gap, documented)**: S6 also grants +60% Hack DMG (on top of the +40% Heavy
ATK DMG already modeled) — this schema has no `hackDmg` damage category (only
skillDmg/basicDmg/heavyDmg/libDmg/echoDmg/coordDmg for hit-composed calc, plus the separate
non-hit-composed `tuneBreak.ruptureDmgMult` table) — not force-fit into the wrong category.

7 new/rewritten tests, full suite green (1316/1316).

## Full kit audit (2026-09-09)

Independent re-audit (not trusting the prior 2026-09-02 pass's own claims of completeness, per
standing audit instruction) of `engine/characterBlocks/lucy.blocks.js`, `characters.js`'s Lucy tables,
and this dump, despite the extensive real work already documented above.

**1 real, significant bug found and fixed**: the base-kit Forte Circuit mechanic "Multi-threading:
with SQL, +270% DMG Multiplier (removes SQL)" (line 132 above) — named explicitly in this dump's own
Algorithm Compaction text, in `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`' own Multi-threading row annotation ("+270% SQL
bonus"), in `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`' own Multi-threading step note, and even in
`lucy.heavy.multi-threading`'s OWN block note — was never actually applied anywhere in either engine.
The prior pass's own S2 audit comment ("raises the SQL DMG Mult from 270% to 560%") shows the 270%
base value was known and named at the time, yet no block ever carried it, and chain.s2's own modeled
value (`totalMult: 30`) didn't correspond to the claimed +290-point jump from that floor either — a
placeholder left over from before the 270% base was correctly sourced, never revisited once it was.

**Fix**: added a new unconditional block `lucy.buff.forte-sql-bonus` (`totalMult: 270`, scoped to
`lucy.heavy.multi-threading`) — modeled unconditional because Algorithm Compaction's own entry (via
the Deadlock cast that opens it) grants exactly 1 SQL stack and nothing in the real modeled rotation
consumes it before Multi-threading fires, so "with SQL" is a real, sourced, always-true condition for
this specific sequence, not a guess. Corrected `chain.s2`'s value from the unsourced 30 to the real
+290 delta on top of that base (270+290=560, matching "270% to 560%" exactly) in both
`lucy.blocks.js` and `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Lucy']`.

**Verification**: measured directly — at Sequence 0 (no chain nodes active), Multi-threading's own
damage is exactly 3.70x (i.e. `1 + 270/100`) with the new block present vs. absent, isolating the
+270% multiplier's effect precisely. `legacyRawDps`/`engineDps` golden snapshots updated (2329 → 2727)
via the established DUMP_GOLDEN pattern, documented with a cited reason in
`phase3-parityGolden.test.js`'s own header; stat-panel `score`/`effAtk`/`avgCrit`/`defMult`/`resMult`
confirmed byte-identical before/after (Lucy's score formula doesn't route through this Sequence-2+
rotation-dependent bonus). 2 new positive-verification tests added to `triggerEngine-lucy.test.js`.

**Also documented (no code change needed)**: `chain.s6`'s "+40% Heavy ATK DMG" is real-kit
target-conditional ("Hack-Shifting/Interfered targets take..."), not a plain self-buff — this schema
has no target-status condition primitive (same documented gap as Mornye's Interfered-Marker Crit DMG
bonus). Confirmed safe to model unconditional for THIS rotation specifically: every one of Lucy's
heavyDmg-categorized blocks fires strictly after `lucy.skill.payload`'s own Hack: Shifting
application, so the target is always already Shifted by the time any Heavy-ATK-categorized hit lands.

**Everything else re-verified this pass, found already correct**: S1/S3/S4/S5's mechanics and
conditions, the S3 `libDmg`-key/`heavyDmg`-category naming split (already deliberately tested, not a
live discrepancy), Thread Shredding/Dual Threading's previously-added values, Payload's full
Charge+Follow-Up total, the Outro/debuff pairing against `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`, `baseDef`, and
`SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`/`CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`/`CHARACTER_DATA` entries generally. Full test suite re-run
and green (1858/1858).
