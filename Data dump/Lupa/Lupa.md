# Lupa — build-guide source dump (cleaned)

5★ Fusion, Broadblade, Hybrid (dedicated Fusion team buffer with solid personal damage). Extended-
rotation buffer who leans on her Ultimate to trigger team-wide "Pack Hunt"/"Glory" buffs (35s, near-
permanent given her own rotation length), then builds toward her Forte Enhanced Skill (Dance With the
Wolf: Climax) via 2 "Wolfaith" stacks. Real-life last update: review Patch 2.4, calcs Patch 3.0, profile
20/August/2026.

## Kit

### Basic Attack — Flaming Star
- **Basic Attack**: up to 4 consecutive hits, Fusion DMG. After Stage 3, Normal Attack in time chains
  into Mid-air Attack Stage 1. After Dodge Counter/Basic Starfall/Shewolf's Hunt/Feral Fang, Normal
  Attack in time chains into Basic Stage 2.
- **Heavy Attack**: STA cost, Fusion DMG.
- **Heavy Attack - Wolf's Gnawing** (replaces Heavy Attack at 50 Wolflame): STA cost, Fusion DMG. Does
  NOT restore Wolflame; consumes 50 Wolflame, grants 1 Wolfaith.
- **Heavy Attack - Wolf's Claw** (replaces Heavy Attack at 50 Wolflame + 1 Wolfaith): STA cost, Fusion
  DMG. Same non-restore/consume/grant rule as Wolf's Gnawing. Chainable via Normal Attack right after
  Mid-air Attack: Firestrike or Wolf's Gnawing if the 50-Wolflame/1-Wolfaith condition is met then.
- **Mid-air Attack**: STA cost, up to 3 hits, Fusion DMG. The combo cycle never resets.
- **Mid-air Attack - Firestrike** (replaces Mid-air Stage 3 at 50 Wolflame): STA cost, Fusion DMG,
  considered Heavy Attack DMG. Same non-restore/consume/grant rule as the enhanced Heavy Attacks.
- **Plunging Attack**: hold Normal Attack airborne, STA cost, Fusion DMG. Normal Attack after chains
  into Basic Attack - Starfall. Also reachable via a Dodge during Mid-air Stage 3/Firestrike.
- **Basic Attack - Starfall**: Fusion DMG.
- **Dodge Counter**: post-Dodge Normal Attack, Fusion DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
- Stage 1: 22.52% + 22.52% + 45.04%
- Stage 2: 90.08%
- Stage 3: 78.84% + 13.14%×6
- Stage 4: 73.87% + 73.87% + 49.25%×2
- Heavy Attack: 56.36% + 56.36%
- Heavy Attack - Wolf's Gnawing: 56.11% + 56.11%
- Heavy Attack - Wolf's Claw: 72.15% + 18.04%×4 + 96.19%
- Mid-air Stage 1: 76.73%
- Mid-air Stage 2: 77.23% + 19.31%×4
- Mid-air Stage 3: 28.48% + 28.48%
- Mid-air Attack - Firestrike: 28.48% + 28.48%
- Plunging Attack: 26.20% + 52.39% + 26.20%
- Basic Attack - Starfall: 12.65%×4 + 118.06%
- Dodge Counter: 34.18%×4 + 136.72%
- STA costs: Heavy Attack/Wolf's Gnawing/Wolf's Claw 25 each; Mid-air Attack 5; Plunging Attack 30;
  Mid-air Attack - Firestrike 30.

### Resonance Skill — Shewolf's Hunt / Feral Fang
- **Shewolf's Hunt**: hurls her Wildfire Banner, Fusion DMG, restores 15 Wolflame, marks the target 8s.
  After casting, a follow-up window opens for Feral Fang. Castable mid-air near the ground. Holding
  Skill instead leaps into the air, chaining into Mid-air Stage 1 on a timed Normal Attack.
- **Feral Fang**: locks onto the target, Fusion DMG, restores 15 Wolflame. DMG Multiplier vs marked
  targets +50%. Enters cooldown if not cast within the window or if Lupa is swapped out. Castable mid-air
  near the ground.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):** Shewolf's Hunt 140.77%; Feral Fang 313.61%. Cooldown 12s.

### Resonance Liberation — Fire-Kissed Glory
Attacks the target, Fusion DMG. Consumes all Wolfaith, restores 100 Wolflame. Basic Attack or Resonance
Skill shortly after chains into Resonance Skill - Foebreaker. Castable mid-air near the ground.

Strengthens the WHOLE TEAM for 35s:
- **Pack Hunt**: all team Resonators gain +6% ATK, and +10% Fusion DMG Bonus specifically against
  Overlord/Calamity-class targets (both non-stackable). With 3 Fusion Resonators on the team, the
  Overlord/Calamity Fusion DMG Bonus additionally +10%. Casting ANY teammate's Intro Skill enhances Pack
  Hunt, granting all Resonators another +6% ATK, up to +18% total (2 enhancements). If Lupa's Pack Hunt
  reaches its cap within its duration, she enters **Wild Hunt** and her Intro Skill is replaced by
  **Nowhere to Run!** (triggerable once per Pack Hunt).
- Active Resonator auto-recovers/is treated as having dodged if hit or launched airborne while grounded
  again — up to 3 times.

**Resonance Skill - Foebreaker**: consumes all Wolflame, Fusion DMG, enters **Burning Matchpoint**.
**Burning Matchpoint**: Normal Attacks restore +500% more Wolflame on hit (functionally moot since
Liberation already fully restores Wolflame); Shewolf's Hunt/Feral Fang can't be cast in this state.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):** Skill (Fire-Kissed Glory) 820.44%; Foebreaker 304.46%. Burning Matchpoint
duration 12s. Cooldown 20s; Resonance Cost 125; Concerto Regen 20.

### Forte Circuit — Ignis Lupa
**Wildfire Banner**: ATK +12% for 8s on casting any of: Feral Fang, Wolf's Gnawing/Wolf's Claw/Firestrike,
Fire-Kissed Glory, Dance With the Wolf/Dance With the Wolf: Climax.

- **Dance With the Wolf** (replaces Resonance Skill at 2 Wolfaith): consumes all Wolfaith, Fusion DMG,
  considered Resonance Liberation DMG. Castable mid-air near the ground.
- **Dance With the Wolf: Climax** (replaces Resonance Skill at 2 Wolfaith while in Burning Matchpoint):
  same consume/DMG-type rule, removes Burning Matchpoint on use. Castable mid-air near the ground.
- **Set the Arena Ablaze** (Resonance Skill slot): within 8s of casting Dance With the Wolf/Climax, Lupa
  stays on-field after swapping and backs up the incoming Resonator's own Resonance Liberation cast with
  a hit of her own, Fusion DMG, considered Resonance Skill DMG. Triggers once per that 8s window.
- **Wolflame** (cap 100): restored by landing Normal Attacks, casting Resonance Skill, casting Resonance
  Liberation.
- **Wolfaith** (cap 2): lasts 10s per stack (duration resets on refresh); each unused stack converts to
  50 Wolflame when its timer expires. Restored by casting Wolf's Gnawing/Wolf's Claw/Firestrike.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
- Dance With the Wolf: 56.02% + 42.02%×4 + 336.11%
- Dance With the Wolf: Climax: 75.63% + 56.72%×4 + 453.75%
- Set the Arena Ablaze: 42.35% + 169.40%

### Inherent Skills
- **Remember My Name**: after dashing 2.5s, enters Sprint — next Basic Attack becomes Basic Attack -
  Starfall. Increased interruption resistance during Wolf's Gnawing/Wolf's Claw/Firestrike.
- **Applause of Victory**: defeating a marked target resets Shewolf's Hunt's cooldown.
- **Resonance Liberation - Glory**: casting Fire-Kissed Glory grants **Glory** for 35s: all team
  Resonators' attacks ignore 3% target Fusion RES, +3% per OTHER Fusion team member (up to +9% total with
  2 others), and with 3 Fusion Resonators total, ignore an ADDITIONAL flat 6% (so up to 15% total Fusion
  RES Ignore at a full Fusion team).

### Intro Skill — Try Focusing, Eh? / Nowhere to Run!
- **Try Focusing, Eh?**: attacks the target, Fusion DMG. Normal Attack shortly after chains into Mid-air
  Stage 3.
- **Nowhere to Run!** (replaces Intro Skill only when Lupa is in Wild Hunt): removes Pack Hunt and Glory
  from the whole team, Fusion DMG, considered Resonance Liberation DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):** Try Focusing, Eh? 29.76% + 42.16%×4; Nowhere to Run! 793.57% + 49.60%×4.
Concerto Regen 10 (each).

### Outro Skill — Stand by Me, Warrior
The incoming Resonator gains +20% Fusion DMG Amplification and +25% Basic Attack DMG Amplification for
14s or until they're switched out.

### Resonance Chain (S1-S6)
- **S1**: Casting Fire-Kissed Glory restores 10 Concerto Energy AND grants +20% Crit Rate for 10s. Gains
  interruption immunity when casting Dance With the Wolf: Climax.
- **S2**: Casting Fire-Kissed Glory, Wolf's Gnawing, Wolf's Claw, OR Firestrike grants the WHOLE TEAM
  +20% Fusion DMG Bonus for 30s, stacking up to 2 times.
- **S3**: Nowhere to Run!'s DMG Multiplier +100%. Fire-Kissed Glory's Pack Hunt no longer requires 3
  Fusion Resonators for its full effect. Fire-Kissed Glory's Glory effect is upgraded: additionally grants
  the WHOLE TEAM +15% Fusion RES Ignore for 35s (replacing/modifying the base scaling version).
- **S4**: Dance With the Wolf: Climax's DMG Multiplier +125%.
- **S5**: Casting Intro Skill (Try Focusing, Eh? OR Nowhere to Run!) grants +15% Resonance Liberation DMG
  Bonus for 10s.
- **S6**: Dance With the Wolf: Climax, Fire-Kissed Glory, AND Nowhere to Run! all ignore 30% target DEF.
  Feral Fang restores 100 Wolflame on hit (once per 20s). Forte Circuit's Dance With the Wolf is replaced
  by Dance With the Wolf: Climax even OUTSIDE Burning Matchpoint (castable any time). Casting Nowhere to
  Run! no longer ends Pack Hunt/Glory.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Crit Rate +8%, ATK% +12%.

### Base Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 11913 | ATK 388 | DEF 1186 | Max Energy 125 | Crit Rate 5% | Crit DMG 150% | Healing Bonus 0% |
Fusion DMG Bonus 0%.

## Review

**Hybrid tier**: **T0.5** (ToA, standard) / **T1** (WW, standard) — **T1** (ToA, Value list) / **T1** (WW,
Value list).

**Pros**
- Very easy to use: 3 free auto-dodges per rotation, easy Forte/Concerto buildup.
- Very strong Fusion team buffs while retaining good personal damage.
- Good non-limited weapon options — clears well without heavy investment.
- Evenly spread damage with good AoE, valuable in Whimpering Wastes (even where some of her conditional
  DMG Bonuses don't apply, it barely matters).
- Lots of exploitable Swap Cancel windows, straightforward kit — accessible to any skill level.

**Cons**
- Nearly locked to mono-Fusion compositions; competes directly with top-tier Sanhua outside them.
- Long field time despite being a buffer — awkward with short-cooldown supports (Shorekeeper/Verina).
- Outro expires on swap despite wanting the 3rd slot and having many swap-cancel windows — quickswapping
  her is only worth it if played precisely.
- Ideally wants a full 3-Fusion-damage-dealer team (including herself), unlike hypercarry comps — real
  extra investment cost just to match top tiers, before even outperforming them.

**Review summary**: Dedicated Fusion team buffer with an extended rotation whose buffs last equally long
(35s), making mono-Fusion team rotations viable despite their length. Her Ultimate (Fire-Kissed Glory) is
the core of her kit: costs 125 Energy on a 20s cooldown (never bottlenecked), fully restores Wolflame,
and triggers team-wide Pack Hunt (+6% ATK, scaling to +18% via 2 teammate Intro casts; +10-20% Fusion DMG
Bonus vs Overlord/Calamity targets depending on Fusion-character count) and Glory (+3-15% Fusion RES
Ignore, same team-composition scaling) for 35s — both essentially permanent given team rotation length,
though they reset when Lupa starts her NEXT rotation via Nowhere to Run!. Fully-enhanced Pack Hunt (2
Intro casts) triggers Wild Hunt, unlocking Nowhere to Run! (a big Liberation-type burst that removes both
buffs on cast). Post-Ultimate, Foebreaker (via Basic/Skill follow-up) sets up Mid-air Attacks; by the
third Mid-air hit she has enough Wolflame for Firestrike, then Wolf's Claw, generating the 2 Wolfaith
needed for her real damage/rotation-ending move, Dance With the Wolf: Climax (the non-Burning-Matchpoint
version is essentially never used — its weaker damage isn't worth staying on-field longer). Her Outro
(Stand by Me, Warrior) amplifies the incoming Resonator's Fusion DMG +20% and Basic Attack DMG +25% for
14s (forfeit on swap). A pseudo-Coordinated-Attack (Set the Arena Ablaze) triggers automatically whenever
a teammate casts THEIR Ultimate within 8s of Lupa's own Forte Enhanced Skill — usually only 1 real trigger
per rotation outside Quickswap play, given her Outro's swap-forfeit nature. Real strength is enabling a
brand-new mono-Fusion archetype (Changli-Brant-Lupa, or Aemeath/Galbrena/Encore-centered variants) where
Lupa buffs the whole team while 1-2 other Fusion damage dealers do the heavy lifting — she is also
notably strong specifically with Encore (short-rotation downtime lines up well with Lupa's own length,
enabling a good F2P Encore-Lupa-Verina/Shorekeeper team even outside full mono-Fusion comps) despite
competing there with Sanhua (Lupa wins on raw buff strength + personal damage at comparable field-time
cost in that specific pairing).

## Build

**Best Weapons** (calculated with Aemeath + Everbright Polestar/Trailblazing Star set + Sigillum, and
Mornye + Discord/Halo of Starry Radiance set + Reactor Husk as teammates):
1. **Wildfire Mark (signature, R1)** — 100.00%. ATK+12%. Intro/Liberation cast: +24% Liberation DMG
   Bonus (6s); a Heavy Attack DMG hit during that window extends it +4s (once) AND grants the WHOLE TEAM
   +24% Fusion DMG Bonus for 30s (same-name non-stacking). Stats: ATK 587, Crit DMG 48.6%. Best by a wide
   margin — high stats plus a real team-wide Fusion DMG buff.
2. **Ages of Harvest** — 87.00%. Attribute DMG+12%. Intro cast grants +24% Resonance Skill DMG Bonus
   (12s); Resonance Skill cast grants another +24% Resonance Skill DMG Bonus (12s). Stats: ATK 587, Crit
   Rate 24.3%. Mostly a Crit Rate/ATK stick — the Skill DMG buff only covers Foebreaker (~1/8 of her real
   damage), so good but not the strongest.
3. **Kumokiri** — 86.70%. ATK+12%. Intro cast or inflicting Negative Statuses grants +8% Liberation DMG
   Bonus (stacks ×3, 15s); at max stacks, teammates inflicting Negative Statuses grant +24% All-Attribute
   DMG Bonus (15s, same-name non-stacking). Stats: ATK 500, Crit Rate 36%. Good alternative if Wildfire
   Mark isn't owned — big Crit Rate at slightly lower ATK.
4. **Verdant Summit** — 84.60%. Resonance Attribute DMG+12%. Intro/Liberation cast grants +24% Heavy
   Attack DMG Bonus (stacks ×2, 14s). Stats: ATK 587, Crit DMG 48.6%. Mostly Crit DMG/ATK stick — only
   buffs Wolf's Claw (~1/16 of her damage).
5. **Thunderflare Dominion** — no clear %, listed as a simple ATK/Crit Rate stick; she doesn't benefit
   from its Heavy-Attack-focused passives.
6. **Radiance Cleaver (best permanent option)** — 80.50%. ATK+12%. Damaging a Tune-Strain-Interfered
   target grants +24% Liberation DMG Bonus (3s, refreshable). Good ATK/Crit DMG stick.
7. **Lustrous Razor (Standard Banner)** — 75.00%. ER+12.8%. Resonance Skill cast grants +7% Liberation
   DMG Bonus (stacks ×3, 12s). A rare case where the Standard Banner weapon is genuinely strong on her —
   real ER need plus a real Liberation DMG buff she can access.
8. **Waning Redshift (R5, best 4★)** — 74.80%. Resonance Skill cast: +10 flat Energy, +20% ATK (16s,
   20s ICD). Eases her real Energy Regen requirement.
9. **Aureate Zenith (R5, Battle Pass)** — 73.10%. Liberation cast: +23% ATK, +34.5% Heavy Attack DMG
   Bonus (15s). Barely benefits from the Heavy ATK portion; lower Base ATK holds it back.
10. **Autumntrace (R5, Battle Pass)** — 68.50%. Basic/Heavy ATK DMG grants +12.8% ATK (stacks ×5, 7s,
    1/s trigger). Hard to stack since she deals mostly Liberation DMG.
11. **Meditations on Mercy (R5, best F2P)** — best fully F2P-accessible option; recommend pulling for
    Lustrous Razor once accessible.

**Best Echo Set**: **Flaming Clawprint** (100.00%). 2pc +10% Fusion DMG. 5pc: Liberation cast grants the
WHOLE TEAM +15% Fusion DMG Bonus AND the caster +20% Liberation DMG Bonus, both 35s (near-permanent given
her rotation). Her dedicated best set — boosts her primary damage type immediately on her own Ultimate
while providing team-wide support, matching her typical Fusion-DPS pairings.
- Main Echo option: **Lioness of Glory** — a strong summon-type Echo (82.08% + 191.52% Fusion DMG,
  usable anywhere in her rotation), plus +12% Fusion DMG Bonus and +12% Liberation DMG Bonus in the main
  slot — best choice for her.

**Best Echo Stats**: 4-cost Crit Rate/Crit DMG · 3-cost Fusion DMG · 3-cost Fusion DMG/ATK% · 1-cost
ATK%×2.
**Substat priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > ATK > Liberation DMG%.

**Best Endgame Stats (Lv.90)**: HP 16000+ | DEF 1100+ | ATK 1800-2500+ | Crit Rate 65-80%+ | Crit DMG
215-260%+ | Energy Regen 115-130%+ (lower end estimated with Changli+Brant, higher end with
Encore+Shorekeeper) | Fusion DMG Bonus 50-80%+.

**Skill Priority**: Resonance Liberation > Intro Skill > Forte Circuit > Basic Attack > Resonance Skill.
Skill can be skipped when leveling to save resources at minimal damage loss.

## Gameplay and Teams

**Damage profile** (1-target scenario, computed from the raw per-category numbers, which sum exactly to
the S0 sequence total of 393,401 — the page's own pie-label percentages didn't cleanly map to categories
in extraction order, so recomputed directly): Basic ~5.1% · Heavy ~6.5% · Skill ~11.4% · Liberation ~72%
· Echo ~5% (Basic 19,965 · Heavy 25,687 · Skill 44,978 · Liberation 283,095 · Intro 0 · Outro 0 · Echo
19,676).

**Rotation time**: 8.14s (1-target scenario, S0-S6 benchmark team). Calculations assume Lupa is on her
2nd rotation or later (several of her buffs — 5pc Flaming Clawprint, Wildfire Mark's own passive, S2
Fusion DMG Bonus, S3 Fusion RES Shred — aren't accessed on the very first rotation, and her Enhanced
Intro, Nowhere to Run!, isn't castable on rotation 1 either).

**Opener Rotation** (no Intro Skill available — used when she opens the team's rotation, e.g. best-team
context): Skill: Shewolf's Hunt → Ultimate → Skill: Foebreaker (Basic or Skill shortly after Ultimate) →
Mid-air Attack 1 → Mid-air Attack 2 → Mid-air Attack: Firestrike (Basic after Mid-air 2) → Heavy: Wolf's
Claw (Basic after Firestrike) → Forte: Skill: Dance With the Wolf - Climax → Outro.

**Loop Rotation** (Intro Skill available): Intro → Ultimate → Skill: Foebreaker → Mid-air Attack 1 →
Mid-air Attack 2 → Mid-air Attack: Firestrike → Heavy: Wolf's Claw → Forte: Skill: Dance With the Wolf -
Climax → Outro.

Echo usage (both rotations): a Summon Echo (e.g. Lioness of Glory) at any point in the rotation; a
Transform Echo (e.g. Nightmare: Inferno Rider) right after her Forte Skill, or before the rotation starts.

Notes on real-game rotation mechanics:
- 3 free auto-dodges after Ultimate cast, plus interruption resistance on Wolf's Claw/Firestrike — she
  should essentially never be interrupted if this rotation is followed consistently.
- Most of her skills take ~1s+ to cast, giving generous swap-in/out windows with little field-time cost.
- Real swap-cancel windows: Skill: Foebreaker, Mid-air Attack 2, Mid-air Attack: Firestrike, Heavy:
  Wolf's Claw, Forte: Skill: Dance With the Wolf - Climax.
- Set the Arena Ablaze (the pseudo-Coordinated-Attack) triggers whenever a teammate casts THEIR Ultimate
  within 8s of Lupa's own Forte Skill cast — time her Forte Skill/Outro near a teammate's own big hits to
  capitalize on it, though its damage is modest and fine to forfeit if inconvenient.
- Swapping out mid-Mid-air-Attack-2/Firestrike leaves her airborne — the combo progress never resets, so
  this is safe to interrupt for a teammate's own combo timing.

**Sequence value** (1-target scenario, S0-S6 benchmark team, S0 = 100% baseline):
- S0: 393,401 DMG / 48,329 DPS (100.00%)
- S1: 453,404 DMG / 55,701 DPS (115.25%)
- S2: 524,086 DMG / 64,384 DPS (133.22%)
- S3: 672,187 DMG / 82,578 DPS (170.87%)
- S4: 807,401 DMG / 99,189 DPS (205.24%)
- S5: 838,625 DMG / 103,025 DPS (213.17%)
- S6: 963,386 DMG / 118,352 DPS (244.89%)

**Synergies** (updated 2026-09-12 from a fresh build-guide snapshot — Jingran didn't exist in this
codebase when the section above was first written; the live page has since folded him in as a 3rd
top-baseline-damage headliner alongside Aemeath/Galbrena, and added Mortefi as his dedicated 3rd-slot
partner):
- **Jingran, Aemeath, Mornye, Galbrena, Brant, Changli, Encore** — all strong partners since she's a
  dedicated Fusion buffer, though she works well with any Fusion damage dealer. Lupa/Mornye are both
  generalist Fusion buffers, elevating any strong-baseline Fusion DPS paired with Lupa. Jingran and
  Aemeath have the highest baseline Fusion damage of the roster, Galbrena not far behind. Brant and
  Encore fully leverage her Outro. Changli buffs Lupa or Aemeath via her own Outro, enabling several
  strong mono-Fusion team shapes with Lupa as the central enabler.

**Example Teams**:
1. **Best Team**: Jingran/Aemeath/Galbrena + Lupa + Mortefi/Denia/Mornye — Jingran should be
   Outro-buffed by Mortefi (Stonewall Bracer main Echo on Moonlit Clouds) for his own best team; Mornye
   is the generalist pick that works with all three headliners (can run the Spacetrek Explorer main
   Echo in Jingran teams specifically); Denia is exclusive to Aemeath in Fusion Burst mode (Lupa runs
   Moonlit Clouds 5pc, Denia runs Flaming Clawprint 5pc instead).
2. **Classic Mono Fusion**: Aemeath/Changli/Galbrena/Encore/Brant + Lupa.
3. **Chixia Best Team**: Chixia + Brant + Lupa.
4. **Encore F2P Team**: Encore + Lupa + Shorekeeper/Chixia — rotate Lupa first with Chixia on the team,
   otherwise rotate Shorekeeper first.

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `lupa.blocks.js`)

## Full kit audit (2026-09-09)

Independent re-audit (this is the first pass with an "App Data Comparison" section — prior work on
this file, per its own header comments, was real and extensive, but never checkpointed into this
dump) of `engine/characterBlocks/lupa.blocks.js` and `characters.js`'s Lupa tables against this dump.

**3 real bugs found and fixed** — all instances of bug classes already found/fixed on other characters
this session, confirming the value of not trusting prior "already audited" claims:

1. **`chain.s1`: dead duration on an unconditional passive.** Was `trigger:{type:'passive'}` PLUS
   `timing:{duration:10}` — the real S1 text ("Casting Fire-Kissed Glory... grants +20% Crit Rate for
   10s", line 122 above) names a real cast anchor that was simply missed (the old note even said "no
   specific cast anchor sourced"). Measured directly: her Intro cast (which fires BEFORE Fire-Kissed
   Glory in the modeled rotation) was silently getting the Crit Rate too — Intro's own damage dropped
   from 3021.15 to 2752.60 once correctly gated. Retargeted to the real `Liberation:Fire-Kissed Glory`
   cast.
2. **`chain.s6`: unscoped `defIgnore` leaking onto the whole kit.** The real text names exactly 3 moves
   ("Dance With the Wolf: Climax, Fire-Kissed Glory, AND Nowhere to Run! all ignore 30% target DEF",
   line 132) but `defIgnore` isn't category-gated (applied unconditionally via `calcDefMult`), so the
   unscoped effect was boosting Foebreaker, Mid-air Attacks, Firestrike, and Wolf's Claw too — none of
   which S6 names. Measured directly: Foebreaker's own damage dropped from 9306.58 to 7914.28 once
   correctly scoped via `scopedToBlockId`.
3. **`chain.s5`: same dead-duration-on-passive class as S1.** Real text: "Casting Intro Skill (Try
   Focusing, Eh? OR Nowhere to Run!) grants +15% Resonance Liberation DMG Bonus for 10s" (line 130) —
   was modeled as an unconditional passive. Split into 2 real cast-anchored blocks (one per Intro
   variant). Measured: NO change to output in the current ~8.14s modeled rotation (a 10s window from
   the very first step already covers every later libDmg hit regardless of anchoring) — fixed anyway
   since the old shape was a real, silent bug waiting to surface the moment a longer/looped rotation or
   delayed Intro entered the picture.

**1 completeness addition**: `Liberation:Nowhere to Run!` (793.57%+49.60%×4, `libDmg`) had a real
SKILL_MULTIPLIERS row but no block anywhere — added `lupa.liberation.nowhere-to-run` for kit
completeness, matching the same convention already used for Lucy/Lucilla's own unused-in-rotation
rows. Genuinely unreachable in the modeled solo rotation (needs Wild Hunt via 2 teammate Intro casts,
same class as Jiyan's S6/Finale), so it fires in no test but is now present for a future team-aware
rotation.

**1 unrelated data bug found and fixed**: the DPS tier table had Lupa at `T0`/`T0.5` (ToA/WW) but this
dump's own Review section is explicit: "Hybrid tier: T0.5 (ToA, standard) / T1 (WW, standard)" — fixed
to `T0.5`/`T1`.

**Verification**: all 3 chain-node fixes and the tier fix measured/cross-checked directly via a
temporary script (deleted after use). The parity-golden DPS snapshot for Lupa is computed at Sequence
0, where none of S1/S5/S6 (all Sequence-gated) apply at all — confirmed no golden fixture update
needed. 6 new positive-verification tests added to `triggerEngine-lupa.test.js`. Full test suite
re-run and green (1865/1865).

**Everything else re-verified this pass, found already correct**: S2/S3/S4's mechanics (including the
prior pass's real fix converting S4 from a dead buff-shaped block into a real proportional damage
block), the Climax-vs-base Forte finisher rotation fix, the Outro/libBuff/selfBuff/debuff pairings
against `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`, `dmgFocus`, and `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`/`CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`/`CHARACTER_DATA`
entries generally.
