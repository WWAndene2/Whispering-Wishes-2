Aero DMG, castable mid-air near ground. **Multipliers (Lv.10):** 33.41%×10+1336.01%. Cooldown 25s, cost 125, Concerto Regen 20.

### Forte Circuit — Formless Heart Sword (Ephemeral Transcendence state)
- **Basic Attack - Ephemeral Transcendence**: up to 4 hits, Aero DMG, castable mid-air. Before Heaven's Reckoning unlocks, DMG Multiplier +100%.
- **Dodge Counter - Ephemeral Transcendence**: post-Dodge Normal Attack, Aero DMG, castable mid-air. Same pre-unlock +100% DMG Multiplier as above.
- **Heavy Attack - Heaven's Reckoning: Ephemeral Transcendence**: available at full Heart Sword Intent. Hold Normal Attack, Aero DMG, consumes all Heart Sword Intent, ends Ephemeral Transcendence.
- **Mindlock** (cap 15): +1 stack whenever any teammate inflicts Tune Strain - Interfered on a target. Each stack Amplifies DMG taken from Qingxiao's Heavy Attack - Stringblade / Ephemeral Transcendence Basic / Ephemeral Transcendence Dodge Counter / Heaven's Reckoning / Liberation by 2% (first 7 stacks give an extra 5% each).
- **Heaven's Clarity**: gained on combat-entry or Liberation cast. Sheathed/Drawn Stance damage doubles Qin Heart/Sword Cadence gain rate. Heavy Attack - Stringblade inflicts 3 Mindlock on nearby targets and enhances the next Heaven's Reckoning (+100% DMG Multiplier, extra Off-Tune Level build); ends on swap-out. Consumed by casting Heaven's Reckoning.
- **Swordlight Ward** (cap 1): gained from Intro or Heavy Attack - Stringblade. On taking a hit, consumes 1 stack for interruption immunity + 60% DMG taken reduction (1s), 1/s trigger cap.
- **Sword Flight**: entered via Sword Dodge, Heavy Attack - Stringblade, Mid-air Stage 1/2, Severing Note: Ascendant, Ephemeral Transcendence Basic/Dodge Counter, Heaven's Reckoning, or Intro. Consumes Flight Qi continuously. Exits via Mid-air Stage 3/Plunging Attack, certain interactions, landing, swapping, or Flight Qi depletion.
- **Sword Step**: hold Jump during Sword Flight to leap/dash forward; once per Sword Flight.
- **Qin Heart / Sword Cadence / Heart Sword Intent**: each cap 100; gained from Sheathed Stance / Drawn Stance / Ephemeral Transcendence damage respectively; Qin Heart and Sword Cadence can't be gained while in Ephemeral Transcendence.

- Heaven's Reckoning: Ephemeral Transcendence: 27.84%×9+445.34%
- Sword Step cooldown 30s; Heaven's Reckoning Concerto Regen 25.

### Inherent Skills
- **Draw and Sunder** (part of Forte, listed with Inherent section): inflicts Shifting after any skill's damage (once per target per skill). Responds to Interfered: 0.12% total DMG per Tune Break Boost point per Interfered stack; +1 max Interfered stack cap while she's in the team. Tune Break unlocked at full Off-Tune Level (chains into Basic Stage 3 on the ground outside Transcendence).
- **Sea of Thought, World of Dust**: gains 1 Gathered Mind on combat entry. After the team defeats a Mindlock target, gains/raises Gathered Mind to match that target's Mindlock stacks (only if empty, or the new value is higher). **Gathered Mind**: after the team damages a target, inflicts Mindlock equal to Gathered Mind stacks (once per target). When the team casts Tune Break on a Shifting target, also inflicts 1 Interfered stack (once per target). Lost/inactive while Qingxiao is knocked out. Caps at 15 stacks, lasts 30s.
- **To Know, To Banish**: Heavy Attack - Stringblade / Ephemeral Transcendence Basic / Ephemeral Transcendence Dodge Counter / Heaven's Reckoning / Liberation deal +2% DMG per Mindlock stack on the target (first 7 stacks +5% each). Any teammate inflicting Interfered on an Overlord/Calamity Class target also inflicts 1 extra Mindlock stack.

### Intro Skill — Tonality Shift
Aero DMG, grants 30 Sword Cadence and Resonant Chime (consumed by the next Severing Note: Judgement cast, which grants 30 Qin Heart). **Multipliers (Lv.10):** 39.79%+46.42%×2. Concerto Regen 10.

### Outro Skill — Lingering Song
Aero DMG equal to 800% of Qingxiao's ATK.

### Resonance Chain (S1–S6)
- **S1**: Crit Rate +16%. Swordlight Ward max stack raised to 2; Heavy Attack - Stringblade also grants 1 Swordlight Ward stack. Gains 25 Exorcising Seal on combat entry. After a Basic Attack/Mid-air/Ephemeral Transcendence Basic hit lands, if she has Exorcising Seal, consumes it to trigger Juque Perdition — Aero DMG = 400% ATK, considered Basic Attack DMG (once per second); each stack consumed adds +4% DMG taken from Juque Perdition for 2s. Exorcising Seal caps at 25.
- **S2**: Heavy Attack - Stringblade DMG Multiplier +40%. Mindlock max stack raised to 25 (after combat entry). Gathered Mind max stack raised to 25. Heaven's Clarity enhanced: Heavy Attack - Stringblade now inflicts 6 Mindlock (up from 3).
- **S3**: Liberation Crit DMG +100%. During Heavy Attack - Stringblade, gains World in Chorus stacks equal to the highest nearby Mindlock count; each World in Chorus stack gives Heaven's Reckoning +3% DMG Multiplier (consumed on cast). Gathered Mind's proc also inflicts 2 Interfered stacks.
- **S4**: After any teammate inflicts Shifting, their ATK +20% for 8s.
- **S5**: Severing Note: Judgement DMG Multiplier +100%. Sword Flight Flight Qi cost -30%.
- **S6**: Targets take +40% more DMG from Heavy Attack - Stringblade / Heaven's Reckoning / Liberation / Juque Perdition. During Heavy Attack - Stringblade, gains Exorcising Seal equal to the highest nearby Mindlock count. Each Mindlock stack Amplifies Juque Perdition DMG taken by +2% (first 7 stacks +5% each) — doubled effect once To Know, To Banish is unlocked (stacks additively per the same rule). Interfered response effect +20%.

### Minor Fortes
+16% Crit Rate, ATK% +12%.

## Review

**DPS tier**: **T0** (ToA, standard) / **T1** (WW, standard) — **T1** (ToA, Value list) / **T2** (WW, Value list).

**Pros**
- High single-target damage, on par with other modern 3.x characters.
- Chases down airborne enemies easily — consistent rotation across boss fights.
- Easiest DPS rotation in the game's history — mostly just holding Basic Attack.

**Cons**
- Very restrictive teambuilding: needs Denia+Mornye specifically, or Lynae + a strong premium support, else falls behind significantly.
- Struggles in multiwave/AoE content (Tune Strain + mid-air focus), similar to Luuk.
- Low sequence value — chain nodes give smaller increases than even Carlotta/Lucy.

**Review summary**: Rotation goal is entering Ephemeral Transcendence to cast Heaven's Reckoning, her biggest hit alongside her Ultimate, base Heavy Attack, and Outro. Nearly the entire rotation past the Intro is just holding Basic Attack, interspersed with one Skill cast and one Ultimate cast. Main mechanic is Tune Strain → Mindlock: her attacks gain up to +65% DMG Amplification from stacked Mindlock (7% for the first 7 stacks, 2% for the next 8). Gains Interruption Immunity + 60% DMG taken reduction for one hit after Intro/base Heavy Attack; inflicts Mindlock on her own Heavy Attack (3 stacks) and whenever teammates apply Tune Strain (1 stack); can apply Mindlock in multi-wave content too. Zero quickswap tolerance once she enters her enhanced state (losing the Heaven's Reckoning enhancement on swap) — pre-building Forte resources before her initial Heavy Attack is the only real optimization lever.

Top of the single-target meta on release; Denia+Mornye confirmed her intended best team. Directly competes with Luuk for the same teammates (her base damage wins that trade). Sigrika, her Aero Main DPS rival, outperforms her in Whimpering Wastes. Expensive to build (near-mandatory Denia+Mornye or Lynae, strong desire for her signature weapon) for a DPS that can't cover all 3 endgame modes efficiently — extremely strong single-target pick, but not a top-level all-rounder.

## Build

**Best Weapons** (calculated with Denia + Forged Dwarf Star/Reel of Spliced Memories set + Voidwing Moth, and Mornye + Discord/Halo of Starry Radiance set + Reactor Husk as teammates):
1. **Glint of Clouds (signature, R1)** — 100.00%. ATK+12%. Inflicting Shifting grants +11.2% Aero DMG Bonus (2s), up to 5 stacks, 0.5s trigger cap; at max stacks, duration extends to 30s and Aero DMG ignores 10% target DEF. Stats: ATK 500, Crit Rate 36%. Best weapon by a lot — huge Aero DMG Bonus and some DEF Ignore on top of a ton of Crit Rate, despite lower base ATK.
2. **Red Spring** — 78.73%. ATK+12%. Basic Attack DMG grants +10% Basic Attack DMG Bonus (14s, 1/s trigger, up to 3 stacks); Concerto Energy consumption grants +40% Basic DMG Bonus (10s, 1/s trigger, ends on swap-out). Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Decent alternative (uses some of the Basic DMG bonus).
3. **Azure Oath** — 78.73%. All-Attribute DMG+12%. (Havoc Bane passive, unused.) Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Simple stat stick.
4. **Everbright Polestar** — 78.48%. All-Attribute DMG+12%. (Tune Rupture/Fusion Burst passive, unused.) Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Simple stat stick.
5. **Emerald Sentence** — 78.18%. ATK+12%. Echo Skill within 10s of Intro/Basic grants a stacking Heavy Attack DMG Bonus (used elsewhere, not by Qingxiao); Intro also grants team +20% Echo DMG Bonus (30s). Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Mostly a stat stick — team Echo buff makes a negligible difference.
6. **Frostburn** — 77.60%. ATK+12%. (Glacio Chafe passive, unused.) Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Simple stat stick.
7. **Emerald of Genesis** — 75.97%. Energy Regen+12.8%. Skill cast: ATK+6%, up to 2 stacks (10s). Stats: ATK 587, Crit Rate 24.3%. Best permanent 5★ option — good ATK/Crit Rate plus an Energy Regen substat saving a roll, though below her Signature.
8. **Blazing Brilliance** — 69.51%. ATK+12%. Searing Feather stacks grant +4%/stack Resonance Skill DMG Bonus (up to 14 stacks) — Skill DMG is largely wasted on Qingxiao, and Crit DMG (not her favored Crit Rate) is the main stat. Stats: ATK 587, Crit DMG 48.6%. Not recommended over any other 5★.
9. **Feather Edge (R5, Battle Pass)** — 65.53%. Liberation cast: ATK+23%, +34.5% Liberation DMG Bonus (15s). Stats: ATK 412, Crit Rate 20.3%. Best 4★ option (default Crit Rate) despite much lower base ATK than any 5★.
10. **Lumingloss (R5, Battle Pass)** — 64.42%. Skill cast: Basic+Heavy DMG +64% (10s, 1/s trigger, 1 stack). Stats: ATK 387, ATK 36.4%. Good ATK but lacks Crit stats.
11. **Commando of Conviction (R5)** — no % listed (lowest, last in list). Intro cast: ATK+30% (15s). Stats: ATK 412, ATK 30.3%. Best permanently-available no-gacha option — simple ATK stick, at best a temporary hold until a real 5★ is available.

**Best Echo Set**: **Heart of Evil's Purge** (100.00%). 2pc: +10% Aero DMG. 5pc: inflicting Shifting grants +20% Crit DMG and +30% Aero DMG Bonus (15s). Same 40% total Aero DMG as the standard Aero set (Sierra Gale) plus 20% Crit DMG, on a condition (Shifting) Qingxiao trivially fulfills.
- Main Echo option: **Calamity Effigy** — main-slot passive grants +20% total Aero DMG Bonus (10% base + 10% conditional on Shifting inflicted, 15s); easily used/Swap Cancelled at the end of her rotation, best stats available on her signature set.

**Best Echo Stats**: 4-cost Crit Rate/Crit DMG · 3-cost Aero DMG · 3-cost ATK% ≥ Aero DMG · 1-cost ATK% ×2.
**Substat priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > ATK > Heavy/Liberation/Basic DMG%.

### Endgame Stat Targets (Lv.90)
HP 14500+ · DEF 1100+ · ATK 2100–2400+ · Crit Rate 55–80%+ · Crit DMG 255–275%+ (before Echo set bonuses) · Energy Regen 110–115%+ (lower end w/ Denia+Mornye/Lynae+Ciaccona, higher end w/ Lynae+Mornye) · Aero DMG Bonus 40–70%+.

### Skill Priority
Forte Circuit > Resonance Liberation > Basic Attack > Resonance Skill > Intro Skill (Intro and Skill both skippable for minimal loss).

## Gameplay & Teams

### Standard Rotation
Intro → Heavy: Stringblade Mid-air 1 → Heavy: Stringblade Mid-air 2 → Heavy: Stringblade Mid-air 3 → Heavy: Stringblade Basic 3 → Heavy: Stringblade Basic 4 → Skill: Judgement → Heavy: Stringblade → Heavy: Transcendence 1 → Heavy: Transcendence 2 → Heavy: Transcendence 3 → Heavy: Transcendence 4 → Heavy: Heaven's Reckoning → Ultimate → Outro.

(Note: the source page's own step labels prefix nearly every Basic/Mid-air Attack step with "Heavy:" — this appears to be the page's own rotation-naming convention/shorthand for "the extended hold-Basic-Attack combo chain," not a claim that every listed step is a literal Heavy Attack input; the surrounding kit text and Additional Tips confirm this is executed by holding Normal Attack, not repeated real Heavy Attacks.)

Near-entirely executed by holding Basic Attack; only the Skill and Ultimate casts require separate inputs. Echo Skill ideally used right before the Outro (Swap-Cancelled after the Ultimate). Forte resources can be pre-built before Intro in quickswap-friendly comps, but Qingxiao doesn't usually run those, so the time savings are minimal. Ultimate timing can shift earlier/later depending on weapon/fight length — the example puts it as late as possible to stack Signature-weapon passive first.

### Synergies
- **Lynae / Denia** — Tune Strain Hybrid buffers she needs to perform at her best. Denia (with Mornye) is strongest overall. Lynae is a fully fine alternative (with Mornye ideally, or Ciaccona/Shorekeeper as it's a more generalist buffer).
- **Mornye / Ciaccona / Shorekeeper** — best Support options. Mornye is the ideal (Tune-Strain-specialized) pick with either Hybrid. If running Lynae, Ciaccona/Shorekeeper are also good with only minimal losses if Mornye is unavailable.

### Example Teams
- **Best Team**: Qingxiao + Denia + Mornye. (No recommended alternatives — dropping Mornye from a Denia pairing causes very significant team DPS losses.)
- **Lynae Team**: Qingxiao + Lynae + Mornye/Ciaccona/Shorekeeper. (Alternatives to Mornye don't suffer as significant a drop-off here.)

## Calculations

### Damage Profile
Basic 451,701 · Heavy 618,355 · Skill 28,035 · Liberation 564,264 · Intro 25,908 · Outro 213,574 · Echo 81,233.
Total: 1,983,070. Heavy 31.2% · Liberation 28.5% · Basic 22.8% · Outro 10.8% · Echo 4.1% · Skill 1.4% · Intro 1.3%.

*(Confirms both Heavy Attack - Stringblade AND Heaven's Reckoning: Ephemeral Transcendence are counted together under "Heavy" — the single largest category at 31.2% — while her nominal "Resonance Skill" category is nearly negligible at 1.4%.)*

### Damage Output by Sequence (1-Target, 12.4s rotation)
- S0: 1,983,121 DMG / 159,929 DPS (100.00%)
- S1: 2,274,805 DMG / 183,451 DPS (114.71%)
- S2: 2,626,406 DMG / 211,806 DPS (132.44%)
- S3: 3,197,303 DMG / 257,847 DPS (161.23%)
- S4: 3,398,673 DMG / 274,086 DPS (171.38%)
- S5: 3,432,236 DMG / 276,793 DPS (173.07%)
- S6: 4,606,477 DMG / 371,490 DPS (232.28%)

No adjacent-sequence pair is byte-identical — every node has a real, distinct DPS contribution (S4→S5 is a small jump, consistent with S5's real effect being conditional/minor Skill-only and Sword Flight utility, not a large flag for a fabricated zero-DPS node).

Calculation build used: Glint of Clouds (R1) + Heart of Evil's Purge 5pc + Calamity Effigy main echo; substats ATK 25.8% / Crit Rate 40.4% / Crit DMG 80.7% / Energy Regen 18.3%.

## Full kit audit (2026-09-09)

Independent re-audit (not trusting the prior 2026-09-01/09-02/09-04 passes' own claims of
completeness, per standing audit instruction) of `engine/characterBlocks/qingxiao.blocks.js` and
`characters.js`'s Qingxiao tables against this dump. **No new bugs found** — this file was already in
excellent shape from prior passes. Specifically re-verified, not just re-read:

- **DPS tier** (`T0`/`T1`) matches this dump's own Review section exactly — no swapped-column bug like
  the one found on Lupa/Phrolova this session.
- **`dmgFocus`** (`['Heavy ATK', 'Liberation', 'Basic ATK', 'Outro']`) correctly reflects this dump's
  own Damage Profile's 4 dominant buckets (all ≥10%), excluding Echo/Skill/Intro (all <5%).
- **`CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`'s multi-stage step collapsing** (e.g. Mid-air Attack Stage 1-3 modeled as one
  combined cast rather than 3 separate steps) verified mathematically lossless: `hitParser.js` treats
  `→` and `+` separators identically, so a flat %ATK total is invariant to how many discrete hits it's
  split into — no damage is lost by the collapsing.
- **The apparent Mindlock double-count risk** — `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Qingxiao'].selfBuffs` still carries a
  `totalMult: 65` entry describing the SAME real mechanic as `qingxiao.debuff.mindlock`'s enemy-side
  `amplify: 65`, with an inline comment claiming it "was never applied to any real computed DPS number
  either." Verified this claim directly rather than trusting it: temporarily removed the `selfBuffs`
  entry and re-ran `calcTeamStats(['Qingxiao'], ...)` — `rawDps` was byte-identical (5895) with and
  without it, confirming the legacy engine's `target:'team'`-only selfBuffs aggregation path genuinely
  never reads this `target:'self'` entry for DPS purposes. Not a live bug; change reverted after
  verification.
- **S1's Juque Perdition proc** (25-charge resource, 1/s ICD, 400% ATK basicDmg hit) remains
  genuinely unbuilt, exactly as already and correctly documented in both `qingxiao.blocks.js`'s own S1
  note and `characters.js`'s RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA comment — a real, sourced, DPS-contributing gap that
  needs a windowed-proc-style block this session didn't build (correctly flagged as non-trivial by the
  prior pass, not silently dropped).

Full existing test suite for this character re-run and confirmed green (14/14) with no changes needed.
