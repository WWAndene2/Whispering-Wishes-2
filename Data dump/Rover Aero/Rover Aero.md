## Kit

### Active skills — Wind Cutter

**Basic Attack**: up to 4 attacks, Aero DMG.
**Heavy Attack**: consumes STA, Aero DMG. Press right after → Basic Stage 3 directly.
**Heavy Attack — Razor Wind**: hold after Basic Stage 3/Dodge Counter/Heavy Attack, Aero DMG.
**Mid-air Attack**: consumes STA, Plunging Attack, Aero DMG. Press after landing → Basic Stage 4.
  At max Windstrings, press after landing → Resonance Skill Unbound Flow.
**Dodge Counter**: after successful Dodge, Aero DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Stage 1 DMG | 35.31% |
| Stage 2 DMG | 43.05%×2 |
| Stage 4 DMG | 76.72% |
| Heavy Attack DMG | 17.91%×3 |
| Razor Wind DMG | 36.37% + 44.46% |
| Mid-air Attack DMG | 140.76% |
| Dodge Counter DMG | 125.43% + 1.99%×25 |

Note: the source's own Multipliers table does not list a separate "Stage 3 DMG" row (only Stages
1/2/4 shown) — not contradicted by the app's existing Stage 3 value (`55.05%+1.99%×25`), just silent
on it, so that existing value is left as-is rather than guessed at or removed.

### Resonance Skill — Illusion Breaker

**Awakening Gale**: jump into mid-air, slash, Aero DMG.
**Skyfall Severance**: while mid-air, press Skill — Aero DMG, strips all Spectro Frazzle/Havoc
Bane/Fusion Burst/Glacio Chafe/Electro Flare stacks from the target hit and inflicts 1 Aero Erosion
stack per stack removed.

| | |
|---|---|
| Awakening Gale DMG | 66.44% + 99.66% |
| Skyfall Severance DMG | 23.37%×3 + 105.15% |
| Awakening Gale Cooldown | 3s |
| Skyfall Severance Cooldown | 12s |

### Resonance Liberation — Omega Storm
Unleashes the Eye of Tempest, Aero DMG + heals all nearby team. Castable mid-air near ground.

| | |
|---|---|
| Skill DMG | 536.79% |
| Healing | 2090 flat + 77.00% ATK |
| Cooldown | 24s |
| Resonance Cost | 150 |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Resonance Chain (Dupes)
- **S1**: Casting Cloudburst Dance grants interruption resistance for 3s.
- **S2**: Casting Unbound Flow continuously heals the on-field Resonator for 20% ATK every 3s for 30s;
  if HP < 35%, immediately restores 10% of lost HP (once per 10s, unaffected by Healing Bonus).
- **S3**: Aero DMG Bonus +15%.
- **S4**: Casting Cloudburst Dance grants +15% Resonance Skill DMG Bonus for 5s.
- **S5**: Omega Storm's DMG Multiplier +20%.
- **S6**: Unbound Flow's DMG Multiplier +30%.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Healing Bonus +12%, ATK% +12%.

### Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 10775 / ATK 438 / DEF 1137 / Max Energy 125 / Crit Rate 5% / Crit DMG 150% / Aero DMG 0%.

### Forte Circuit — Cycle of Wind

**Mid-air Attack — Cloudburst Dance**: up to 2 attacks, Aero DMG (considered Resonance Skill DMG),
heals nearby team. Cast via: pressing after Awakening Gale, after Intro Skill, or after Razor Wind
(rarely used); holding continues into a normal Mid-air Attack.

**Resonance Skill — Unbound Flow** (replaces Awakening Gale at max Windstrings): up to 2 attacks, each
consumes 60 Windstrings, Aero DMG, considered Resonance Skill DMG. Switching off after Stage 1
auto-triggers Stage 2.

**Windstring** (cap 120): +25 per Cloudburst Dance stage hit, +20 on Intro cast, +10 on Basic Stage
3/4 or Dodge Counter hit.

| | |
|---|---|
| Cloudburst Dance Stage 1 DMG | 128.80% |
| Cloudburst Dance Stage 2 DMG | 141.47% |
| Cloudburst Dance Healing | 627 flat + 23.10% |
| Unbound Flow Stage 1 DMG | 34.30%×5 |
| Unbound Flow Stage 2 DMG | 723.03% |
| Unbound Flow Concerto Regen per Stage | 20 |

### Inherent Skills
- **Sand in the Storm**: casting Intro grants +20% ATK for 10s.
- **Boundless Winds**: Omega Storm's Healing +20%.

### Intro Skill — Relentless Squall
Aero DMG. Multiplier: 79.53% + 119.29%.

### Outro Skill — Storm's Echo
Grants Aeolian Realm to nearby team for 30s: on hit, +3 max Aero Erosion stack cap for 10s (not
stackable). Pure stack-cap increase, no direct DMG buff.

## Review

- DPS Tier (as Support): T1 (Tower of Adversity), T1.5 (Whimpering Wastes). Value Tier: T1 / T2.
- **Pros**: personal damage stands out vs other Supports despite healing capability; signature weapon
  is fully F2P (character + Chain Nodes free); unique debuff-conversion + debuff-stack-cap mechanics;
  synergizes with Cartethyia+Ciaccona to elevate that team further; specializes in mid-air combat
  (dodges certain enemy attacks).
- **Cons**: functional in exactly ONE team (Cartethyia+Ciaccona); damage doesn't justify field time vs
  faster-buffing Supports; signature weapon locks out higher-damage options; buffing potential barely
  above low-tier generalists like Baizhi; mid-air attacks inconsistent vs small enemies (can miss
  outright); no one currently applies debuffs well enough to convert; blocks other Rover elements from
  the team; currently locked to S1/R1.
- Free 5★ Aero Support: applies Aero Erosion via debuff conversion, amplifies Aero DMG, some healing +
  personal damage. Built around mid-air combat to charge Forte.
- Windstring (cap 120): 4 Forte Mid-Air Attacks (25 each) + Intro (20) = 120 exactly. With Cartethyia
  on team, her Inherent Skill funnels 25 Windstring on Ultimate cast — but this alone doesn't generate
  enough Concerto to finish a rotation with Outro, so it must be paired with a weave-in mid-combo
  (typically a Fleurdelys Skill 2 swap-in for one Plunging Attack).
  Cloudburst Dance (Forte Mid-Air) casts 2 at a time, heals the party; accessed via Awakening Gale,
  Intro, or (impractically) Razor Wind — Razor Wind is never realistically used.
  Ultimate does solid damage AND provides all her healing in one burst; castable mid-air, which grounds
  her instantly (better than a slow plunge for repositioning).
  Forte Enhanced Skill (Unbound Flow) — both parts generate 20 Concerto each (huge), deal big damage
  (higher multiplier than Danjin's Ultimate), and trigger her signature's Aero DMG Amp passive. Ground
  only; swapping out after Part 1 instantly triggers Part 2 off-field (delayed Concerto gain) — a
  Swap Cancel window systematically used in optimal rotations, saving time at no damage cost.
  Outro's only real use case: +3 Aero Erosion stack cap (up to 6 total), enabling Cartethyia's
  additional Ultimate DMG Amp effects — otherwise barely useful.
- Meta position: restricted to Cartethyia+Ciaccona team; no other character exploits her Aero Erosion
  stack-cap mechanic; competes poorly with Verina/Shorekeeper as a generalist due to her locked-R1
  signature (only 10% Aero DMG Amp vs their 15% all-type DMG Amp + more). Mid-air-attack reliability
  issues hurt her badly in Whimpering Wastes (small enemies). Only recommended if you own BOTH
  Cartethyia and Ciaccona.

## Build

**Best Weapon**: Bloodpact's Pledge (signature, F2P) — Providing Healing → +10% (R1) to +26% (R5)
Resonance Skill DMG for 6s; casting Unbound Flow → Amplifies nearby team's Aero DMG +10% (R1) to +26%
(R5) for 30s. 100% at R1, 121.12% at R5. No other weapon is compared in this build guide — her kit is
weapon-locked to her own signature.

**Best Echo Set**: Rejuvenating Glow (100%) — 2pc: Healing +10%. 5pc: healing an ally → team ATK +15%
for 30s. Main Echo: Bell-Borne Geochelone (best for Cartethyia teams — Cartethyia can't use ATK% but
benefits from Geochelone's DMG%; also blocks 50% DMG from up to 3 hits). Alt (situational, high
investment only): Windward Pilgrimage (2pc: +10% Aero DMG; 5pc: hitting an Aero Erosion target → +10%
Crit Rate + 30% Aero DMG Bonus for 10s) with main echo Reminiscence: Fleurdelys (+10% unconditional
Aero DMG, +10% more for Rover: Aero specifically, in main slot).

**Substats priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > Skill DMG% > ATK.

**Endgame stat targets (Lv.90)**: HP 15000+, DEF 1150+, ATK 2100+, Crit Rate 65%+, Crit DMG 210%+,
Energy Regen 128-138% (128% with Iuno+Ciaccona, 138% with Cartethyia+Ciaccona) — no ER substats needed
since Bloodpact's Pledge alone covers it. Aero DMG Bonus 30-60%+.

**Skill priority**: Forte Circuit > Liberation > Skill > Intro > Basic Attack.

## Gameplay and Teams

**Echo Usage**: use her Echo right before switching out (after Unbound Flow P1) to maximize buff
uptime while still enhancing her biggest damage chunk.

**Standard Rotation** (with Intro): Intro → Forte: Cloudburst Dance P1 → P2 → Ultimate → Skill:
Awakening Gale → Forte: Cloudburst Dance P1 → P2 → Skill: Skyfall Severance (optional) → Mid-Air Atk
(Plunge) → Forte: Unbound Flow P1 (switch out) → Outro → Forte: Unbound Flow P2 (auto, off-field).

**Opener Rotation** (no Intro): (Swap-in) Basic P2 → Basic P3 → Skill: Awakening Gale → Forte:
Cloudburst Dance P1 → P2 → Mid-Air Attack (Plunge) → Basic P4 → Skill: Awakening Gale → Forte:
Cloudburst Dance P1 → P2 → Ultimate → Forte: Unbound Flow P1 → Outro → Forte: Unbound Flow P2 (auto).

**Synergies**: Cartethyia (her main partner — Aero DMG Amp + Aero Erosion stack cap; without Ciaccona,
Cartethyia can't fully stack Erosion, so Shorekeeper/Verina are preferred until Ciaccona joins). Iuno
(best buffer for Main DPS Iuno — easily-upkept 26% Aero DMG Amp on rotation finish; also boosts
Ciaccona's damage via the Erosion stack cap if she's present; can pair with Jiyan+Iuno for a
buff/heal/personal-damage mix). Jiyan (Aero DMG Amp via her free signature + easy Rejuvenating Glow
triggers via healing; Jiyan can't exploit Aero Erosion himself, but Ciaccona can as an alt buffer).
Ciaccona (best Aero Erosion applier/amplifier in the game — pairs best with Rover: Aero via
Rejuvenating Glow, the Outro's stack-cap increase, and her weapon's Aero DMG Amp).

**Example Teams**: Best Team (implied: Cartethyia + Ciaccona + Rover: Aero), Main DPS Iuno Team
(implied: Iuno + Ciaccona + Rover: Aero), Jiyan Team (implied: Jiyan + Ciaccona + Rover: Aero) — exact
roster icons weren't machine-readable in this extraction, inferred from the Synergies section text
directly above, which names these exact same 3 combinations explicitly.

## Damage Profile (calc, solo, no team buffs)
Skill 67.3% (77,859) / Liberation 18.9% (21,860) / Intro 6.6% (7,666) / Basic 5% (5,732) / Echo (2,537)
/ Heavy 0 / Outro 0. Rotation time 5.96s. S0: 115,655 DMG (19,408 DPS).

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `roveraero.blocks.js`)

No dump file existed before this pass — created. SKILL_MULTIPLIERS and RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA values
already matched this source exactly. Several real bugs found and fixed:

**Real bugs found and fixed**:
1. `bestWeapon` was `'Emerald of Genesis'` — not mentioned anywhere in this source's Best Weapons
   section, which shows ONLY her own signature (Bloodpact's Pledge, the sole weapon compared in this
   build guide). Fixed to `"Bloodpact's Pledge"`.
2. `bestEchoes` named `'Gusts of Welkin 5pc'` (not mentioned in source) and `'Reminiscence: Fleurdelys'`
   as primary, when the real best/default set is Rejuvenating Glow (100%) with Bell-Borne Geochelone as
   its main echo — Fleurdelys is only the main echo for the situational high-investment alt set
   (Windward Pilgrimage). Fixed to `['Bell-Borne Geochelone', 'Rejuvenating Glow 5pc']`.
3. `teams` named `'Rover: Aero + Jinhsi + Shorekeeper'` — Jinhsi is never mentioned anywhere in the
   source; real teams per Synergies/Example Teams are Cartethyia+Ciaccona (best), Iuno+Ciaccona (Main
   DPS Iuno team), Jiyan+Ciaccona (Jiyan team). Fixed to name the two most-endorsed combinations.
4. `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`'s `outroBuffs`/`libBuffs` both encoded real non-DPS mechanics (an Aero Erosion
   stack-cap increase, a healing formula) under a fabricated `totalMult` key that doesn't represent a
   damage multiplier at all — would inject a false DMG bonus into any consumer reading it at face
   value. Zeroed both (the TriggerBlocks engine had already independently avoided using them). Real
   mechanics documented in the `note` field instead.
5. `chain.s4` was modeled as an unconditional passive `skillDmg:15` — the kit text is explicit this is
   a 5s window on Cloudburst Dance cast. Converted to a real cast-scoped buffWindow.
6. `chain.s5` was `kind:'buff', trigger:{type:'cast',...}, timing:{}` — the same dead cast-scoped/
   no-duration no-op shape found on Carlotta/Galbrena/Lucy (the engine-architecture history (git log) item 12, 8th
   confirmed instance) — never actually applied. Fixed via `trigger:{type:'passive'}` +
   `scopedToBlockId`.
7. `chain.s6` was an unscoped passive `skillDmg:30` — silently over-crediting Cloudburst
   Dance/Awakening Gale/Skyfall Severance, none of which S6's own kit text lists ("DMG Multiplier of
   Resonance Skill Unbound Flow is increased by 30%" — Unbound Flow only). Fixed via `scopedToBlockId`
   (Augusta's S3 over-crediting fix pattern).

7 new/rewritten tests, full suite green (1319/1319).

**2026-09-09 full kit audit** (independent re-derivation, zero deference to the pass above —
re-verified all 7 prior fixes still hold; cross-checked `CHARACTER_DATA`, `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`,
`RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA`, `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`, `SKILL_ICONS`, `SEQUENCE_NAMES`, and `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`
for Rover: Aero against this dump fresh). Found 3 more real bugs:

8. **Comment/code mismatch — missing `damage.category`**: `roveraero.intro.relentless-squall`'s header
   comment already claimed "category added for Layer 4 schema migration... same default-to-skillDmg
   convention", but the actual `damage.category` field was never set on the block — a stale/aspirational
   comment that never matched the code, confirmed by direct inspection. Fixed to `skillDmg`, matching
   the convention actually applied on Sanhua/Baizhi/Taoqi's equivalent uncategorized-Intro fixes.
9. **`dmgFocus` missing a genuine damage-share type**: `CHARACTER_DATA['Rover: Aero'].dmgFocus` was
   `['Skill', 'Liberation']`, omitting `'Basic ATK'` despite this dump's own Damage Profile showing a
   genuine 5% (5,732) Basic ATK share via her Mid-air Plunging Attack — already correctly
   `basicDmg`-categorized in `roveraero.blocks.js`. Added `'Basic ATK'` at the time — **then reverted**
   (direct user follow-up after Sigrika's own audit surfaced this project's established dmgFocus
   threshold convention, documented on Jiyan's/Calcharo's own rows: a ~4.6–5.5% share is the "exclude"
   example, 6.8%+ is "include"). At exactly 5%, this addition landed inside the documented exclude
   range it should have been compared against — reverted to match Jiyan's own excluded 5.1% Intro
   precedent instead. `dmgFocus` stays `['Skill', 'Liberation']`.
10. **`maxEnergy` miscopy**: `BASE_STATS`'s row for Rover: Aero stored `maxEnergy: 150`, but this dump's
    own Stats section states "Max Energy 125" — 150 is actually Liberation Omega Storm's own Resonance
    Cost figure ("Resonance Cost | 150"), the same miscopy bug class already found and fixed on
    Shorekeeper's and Mornye's `maxEnergy` rows. `calcEngine.js` reads `maxEnergy` directly as the
    Liberation cast's resource cost for its ER-uptime cycling calc, so the wrong value understated her
    real Liberation cast frequency. Fixed to 125. Verified via direct before/after measurement of the
    real `phase3-parityGolden.test.js` calc: `legacyRawDps`/`engineDps` rose from 1087 to 1094/1094
    (+~0.6%), a real and expected consequence of more frequent Liberation casts — golden fixture updated
    with a cited reason in `phase3-parityGolden.test.js`'s own header-comment log.

No other cross-checked dimension showed drift: `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE` (empty outroBuffs/libBuffs/selfBuffs/
debuffs, matching the non-DPS nature of her Outro/Liberation mechanics), `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`,
`SKILL_ICONS`, `SEQUENCE_NAMES`, `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`, and the DPS tier table all still match this
dump exactly. The cross-character Aero Erosion stack-cap interaction with Cartethyia/Ciaccona remains
correctly unmodeled (no stateful cross-character stack-tracking mechanism exists in this engine —
consistent with the same limitation already documented and accepted for every other character's
comparable cross-character mechanic this session, e.g. Roccia's Reality Recreation investigation).

3 new tests added in `triggerEngine-roveraero.test.js` (Intro category, dmgFocus Basic ATK inclusion,
maxEnergy value). Full suite green (1879/1879).

**Follow-up revert**: `dmgFocus`'s `'Basic ATK'` addition was reverted per item 9's updated writeup
above — the dmgFocus test was updated to assert exclusion instead of inclusion. Full suite re-verified
green after the revert.
