## Kit

### Basic Attack — Origin Calculus

- **Basic Attack**: up to 4 consecutive hits, Spectro DMG. Each hit generates 1 Collapsed Core.
- **Heavy Attack**: hold Normal Attack to enter **Unbound Form** (continuous STA drain) — generates 1 Deductive Data/sec, auto-collects nearby plant collectibles. Ending it (STA depleted or casting Basic Attack) deals Spectro DMG; each Deductive Data segment converts to Empirical Data and generates a Collapsed Core.
- **Mid-air Attack**: consumes STA, plunging attack, generates 1 Collapsed Core. Chains into Basic Stage 2 shortly after.
- **Dodge Counter**: Normal Attack after a successful Dodge, Spectro DMG.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Basic ATK Stage 1 | 31.78% |
| Basic ATK Stage 2 | 23.86%×2 |
| Basic ATK Stage 3 | 23.32%×3 |
| Basic ATK Stage 4 | 72.72% |
| Heavy Attack | 45.81% |
| Plunging Attack | 73.96% |
| Dodge Counter | 87.48%×2 |
| Heavy Attack STA cost | 25 |
| Plunging Attack STA cost | 30 |

### Resonance Skill — Chaos Theory

- Heals all nearby team members, summons 5 **Dim Star Butterflies** (auto-track and attack, Spectro DMG). Chains into Basic Attack Stage 2 shortly after. Castable mid-air.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Dim Star Butterfly | 31.31% |
| Healing | 1313 + 5.97% HP |
| Cooldown | 16s |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Resonance Liberation — End Loop

- Generates the **Outer Stellarealm**: continuously heals all team members within range (once per 3s).
- **Inner Stellarealm** (evolves from Outer when a team member uses their Intro within it): +0.01% team Crit Rate per 0.2% of Shorekeeper's Energy Regen, up to +12.5%. Retains Outer's effects.
- **Supernal Stellarealm** (evolves from Inner on a 2nd Intro within it): +0.01% team Crit DMG per 0.1% of Shorekeeper's Energy Regen, up to +25%. Retains Inner's effects. Shorekeeper's first Intro cast during its duration is replaced with **Intro Skill: Discernment** (once per Supernal Stellarealm generation).

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Healing | 438 + 2.39% HP |
| Stellarealm duration | 30s |
| Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Energy cost | 175 |
| Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Forte Circuit — Astral Chord

- **Flare Star Butterfly**: a Normal Attack hit generates a Collapsed Core, which becomes a Flare Star Butterfly (auto-track/attack, Spectro DMG) after 6s. Cap 5 Collapsed Cores — the next hit at cap instantly converts one.
- **Illation**: at 5 Empirical Data, casting Heavy Attack consumes them all to pull in nearby targets + Spectro DMG; also instantly converts all Collapsed Cores into Flare Star Butterflies.
- **Transmutation**: at 5 Empirical Data, casting Mid-air Attack consumes them all for Spectro DMG; also instantly converts all Collapsed Cores. Chains into Basic Stage 2 shortly after.
- **Empirical Data** (cap 5): +1 from Basic Stage 1/2/4 hit; +2 from Basic Stage 3 hit; +1 from Mid-air Attack hit; +1 from Dodge Counter hit.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Flare Star Butterfly | 37.29% |
| Illation | 18.97%×5 |
| Transmutation | 73.96% |
| Illation STA cost | 25 |
| Transmutation STA cost | 30 |
| Illation Concerto Regen | 6 |
| Transmutation Concerto Regen | 6 |

### Inherent Skills

- **Life Entwined**: another Resonator taking a fatal blow instead survives, healed for 50% of Shorekeeper's HP, while Shorekeeper loses the same amount (floor 1 HP). Once per 10 min.
- **Self Gravitation**: while the on-field Resonator is within a Stellarealm, Shorekeeper's Energy Regen +10%. If Rover is on the team, Rover also gets +10% Energy Regen.

### Intro Skill — Proof of Existence

- **Enlightenment** (base): heals all nearby team members + summons 5 Dim Star Butterflies (Spectro DMG), **counted as Resonance Skill DMG**.
- **Discernment** (replaces the above once per Supernal Stellarealm generation): ends the current Stellarealm, heals all nearby team members, deals Spectro DMG — guaranteed Crit, **counted as Resonance Liberation DMG**.

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Value |
|---|---|
| Enlightenment | 45.30%×5 |
| Discernment | 19.64%×3 HP |
| Enlightenment Healing | 259 + 1.20% HP |
| Discernment Healing | 289 + 1.32% HP |
| Enlightenment Concerto Regen | 10 |
| Discernment Concerto Regen | 20 |

### Outro Skill — Binary Butterfly

- Summons 1 Flare Star Butterfly + 1 Dim Star Butterfly to circle the on-field Resonator for up to 30s: if that Resonator is hit/launched, tapping Dodge instantly recovers (triggers a successful Dodge; launched-near-ground lands standing), up to 5 times. Grants all nearby team members +15% DMG Amplification.

### Resonance Chain (Sequences)

- **S1**: Stellarealms' healing/buff range +150%, duration +10s. Casting Discernment no longer ends the existing Stellarealm.
- **S2**: Outer Stellarealm additionally grants nearby team members +40% ATK.
- **S3**: casting Liberation grants Shorekeeper 20 Concerto Energy (once per 25s).
- **S4**: +70% Healing Bonus when casting Chaos Theory (Skill).
- **S5**: Basic Attack Stage 3's pull range +50%, Illation's pull range +30%.
- **S6**: Discernment DMG Multiplier +42%. Casting Discernment grants +500% Crit DMG.

### Minor Fortes
HP% +12%, Healing Bonus +12%.

### Base Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 16713 · ATK 288 · DEF 1100 · Max Energy 125 · Crit Rate 5% · Crit DMG 150%

## Review

**DPS tier**: **T0** (Tower of Adversity, standard) / **T0.5** (Whimpering Wastes, standard) / **T0** (Tower of Adversity, Value) / **T0.5** (Whimpering Wastes, Value) — labeled **Support**.

**Pros**
- Unique, incredible Crit Rate and Crit DMG buffs.
- Tremendous continuous team healing.
- Full-team DMG Amplification that isn't lost on swap.
- Excellent carrier of the Rejuvenating Glow set.
- Surprisingly high damage with the empowered Intro (if built for it).
- Incredibly flexible — usable in many teams.

**Cons**
- Really wants a Concerto-generating weapon, feels notably worse without one.
- Can have a slow start in Tower of Adversity depending on team composition.
- Lacks the Coordinated Attacks mechanic Verina has, lowering her potential vs. characters that synergize with that.

**Key mechanics**
- Liberation (End Loop, 175 Energy) summons the **Stellarealm** for 30s — 3 stacking stages: Outer (baseline: heal every 3s), Inner (after 1 ally Intro within it: up to +12.5% team Crit Rate scaling with her Energy Regen), Supernal (after a 2nd Intro within it: up to +25% team Crit DMG scaling with her Energy Regen). Reaching full Supernal (12.5% Crit Rate + 25% Crit DMG + continuous healing) requires ~250% Energy Regen (150% from Echo/Weapon/Passives) — also a comfortable checkpoint for reliable Liberation access. 25s cooldown, plannable near-permanent uptime.
- Outro grants the whole party +15% DMG Amplification for 30s regardless of swaps, plus up to 5 free interruption recoveries (tap Dodge) for the on-field Resonator.
- Game plan: generate Concerto fast → Liberation → immediately Outro to trigger an ally's Intro (upgrades the Stellarealm right away) → only 1 more Intro needed to fully upgrade it.
- Forte "Astral Chord": two 5-cap resources — Collapsed Cores (from any Basic Attack, become Flare Star Butterflies after 6s, generating Concerto) and Empirical Data (from Basic Attacks, +2 on Stage 3) which at 5 charges enhances her next Heavy Attack (**Illation** — preferred, has Pull) or Mid-air Attack (**Transmutation**) into a Concerto-generating Spectro nuke that also instantly converts all Collapsed Cores.
- Skill (Chaos Theory) grants 20 Concerto instantly + team heal + summons 5 Dim Star Butterflies (≈30 Concerto total once they land) — 16s cooldown, cast whenever available and not already at full Concerto; chains into Basic Stage 2.
- Two Intro skills: base **Enlightenment** always available, empowered **Discernment** available once per Supernal Stellarealm — ends the Stellarealm early (usually a non-issue since she's normally swapped in only to refresh it anyway) but generates double Concerto, deals HP-scaling damage (a surprisingly large nuke), always Crits, and heals slightly more.
- Inherent Skills: standard Cheat Death (Life Entwined); +10% Energy Regen while any Resonator is inside a Stellarealm (counts toward the 250% target, effectively only 240% needed from gear) — also buffs Rover's Energy Regen if present.

**Meta position**: shares Verina's role (fits almost any team) but her buffs are Crit-based rather than ATK%-based, usually giving higher raw damage multiplication than Verina excluding other synergies. Unlike Verina, requires a strict rotation since her buffing is entirely tied to Liberation + Outro. No particular synergy requirement — broadly effective with everyone, making her the most widely usable, generally-effective Support in the game.

## Build

### Best Weapons
| Weapon | Score |
|---|---|
| Variation (R5, 4★) | 100.00% |
| Stellar Symphony (R1, signature) | 116.30% (listed above Variation despite being "best weapon... but not by a big difference") |
| Rectifier#25 (R5, 4★, F2P craftable) | 87.20% |
| Call of the Abyss (R5, 4★, free via Rinascita exploration quest) | 85.10% |

**Signature (Stellar Symphony)**: +12% HP; Liberation restores 8 Concerto Energy (once per 20s); casting a healing Resonance Skill grants nearby team members +14% ATK for 30s (same-name effects don't stack). Her best weapon, but not by a big margin over Variation — provides less Concerto than an R5 Variation, noticeably slowing her opener; strong Energy Regen makes hitting 230% easy.
**Variation**: Skill cast restores 16 Concerto Energy (once per 20s) plus massive Energy Regen — significantly speeds and smooths her rotation, one of the best choices, very close to Signature even at R1.
**Rectifier#25**: best gacha-free option — Energy Regen + a small conditional ATK% boost on Skill cast.
**Call of the Abyss**: more healing-focused free option (Liberation grants +16% Healing Bonus for 15s) — same Energy Regen as Rectifier#25, preferable if more team healing is desired, not a necessity.

### Best Echo Sets

**1) Rejuvenating Glow** — 2pc: +10% Healing. 5pc: healing allies grants the whole team +15% ATK for 30s. Triggerable via character abilities and weapon effects, easy 100% uptime, big help to all party members.
Main Echo: **Fallacy of No Return** — +10% Energy Regen on cast (lets a Spectro DMG 3-cost be run on 4★ weapons while still hitting 230% ER, boosting her personal damage); also +10% team ATK for 20s and HP-scaling damage. Generally her best choice.
Main Echo alt: **Bell-Borne Geochelone** — worse for damage nowadays (shorter uptime: +10% DMG Bonus for 15s only) but a good fallback without a good Fallacy roll; also blocks 50% DMG on up to 3 hits for extra survivability if desired.

**Special set: Moonlit Clouds** — 2pc: +10% Energy Regen (unconditional). 5pc: casting Outro grants the next Resonator +22.5% ATK for 15s, amplifying a Main DPS's burst window.
Main Echo: **Impermanence Heron** — trades the wearer's personal damage for team benefit; use and immediately swap-cancel right before Outro. Grants the next character +12% DMG% (stacks with 5pc Moonlit's own +22.5% ATK% under the same trigger) plus a large Energy chunk on use, often saving 1-2 Energy Regen substats otherwise needed.

**Best Echo Stats**: 4-cost Crit DMG > HP% · 3-cost Energy Regen · 3-cost Energy Regen / Spectro DMG · 1-cost HP% ×2.
**Substat priority**: Energy Regen (until 230%) > Crit DMG ≥ Liberation DMG% > HP% > Crit Rate > HP > ATK% = ATK.
Note: ER/Spectro DMG main-stat on the 3-cost slot is the personal-damage end-goal but hard without her Signature — always prioritize hitting the 230% Energy Regen requirement first (250% total with Fallacy of No Return + passive).

### Endgame Stat Targets (Lv.90)
HP 20000-35000+ · DEF 1100+ · Crit Rate 20-40%+ · Crit DMG 220-280%+ · Energy Regen 230% before Echo/Passive (up to 250% total counting her passive + Fallacy of No Return, or 240% with a different Echo) · Spectro DMG Bonus 0-30%.
Note: her personal damage is very low — investing in it is fully skippable; Energy Regen is by far the most important stat.

### Skill Priority
Intro Skill > Resonance Skill > Basic Attack > Forte Circuit > Resonance Liberation.

## Gameplay & Teams

### Opener Rotation (no Intro/Concerto available, e.g. Tower of Adversity start)
Basic P1 → Basic P2 → Basic P3 → Basic P4 → Forte: Heavy ATK Illation → Basic P1 → Basic P2 → Basic P3 → Basic P4 → Forte: Heavy ATK Illation → Skill: Chaos Theory → Echo → Liberation → Outro.

### Standard Rotation (Intro/Concerto available)
Intro Skill: Discernment → Basic P1 → Basic P2 → Basic P3 → Basic P4 → Forte: Heavy ATK Illation → Skill: Chaos Theory → Echo → Liberation → Outro.

Both rotations need 6-8 extra Concerto Energy to function smoothly — easily covered by Variation S1 or her Signature; without either, supplement with extra Basic Attacks or a Dodge Counter.

### Synergies

Very flexible — usable as the 3rd-slot buffer for any current team. No particular required synergy; effective with everyone.

### Example Teams
- **Augusta Team**: Augusta + Iuno + Mortefi + The Shorekeeper.
- **Carlotta Team**: Carlotta + Zhezhi + The Shorekeeper.
- **Zani Team**: Zani + Phoebe + The Shorekeeper.
- **Camellya Team**: Camellya + Roccia + Sanhua + The Shorekeeper.

## Calculations

### Real Damage-Type Breakdown (the guide's own simulated rotation, S0, solo/no buffs)
| Type | DMG | Share |
|---|---|---|
| Basic ATK | 2,335 | (small, part of 12.4% combined label) |
| Heavy ATK | 1,222 | (small) |
| **Skill** | 2,017 | shown as one of the small-slice labels ("1/2") |
| **Liberation** | 36,251 | **75.9%** (largest wedge) |
| Intro | 0 | 0% |
| Outro | 0 | 0% |
| Echo | 5,911 | (small, part of 12.4% combined label) |

Note: matches her kit — Discernment (Intro) is explicitly "counted as Resonance Liberation DMG," so essentially all real burst damage funnels into the Liberation category despite the Intro-slot input; Enlightenment (base Intro) is "counted as Resonance Skill DMG." No full Damage Output/Sequence table was provided on this page (no numeric S0→S6 table present), consistent with the Build tab's own note that her personal damage is fully skippable to invest in.

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `shorekeeper.blocks.js`)

First full 9-dimension Phase A pass for this character — no prior App Data Comparison existed.
SKILL_MULTIPLIERS, CHARACTER_ROTATIONS, CHAR_BUFF_TABLE, RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA, base stats, `bestEchoes`,
and `dmgFocus` (`['Liberation']`, matching this source's own 75.9% Liberation share) all already matched
this source exactly.

**Real bugs found and fixed (2026-09-04)**:
1. **Flare Star Butterfly damage was completely unmodeled**, dimension 8 — found via a full kit
   walkthrough, not caught in this character's original conversion pass. It's not an alternate unused
   variant: the modeled rotation's 4-stage Basic ATK combo generates exactly 4 Collapsed Cores (kit
   text: "each hit generates 1 Collapsed Core"), and the very next step, Illation, explicitly "instantly
   converts all Collapsed Cores into Flare Star Butterflies" — so 4 real 37.29%-ATK hits fire every
   single rotation, guaranteed, previously contributing zero damage. Added as
   `shorekeeper.forte.flare-star-butterfly`, riding the existing Illation trigger. Category had no
   explicit "considered X DMG" override anywhere in the kit text — flagged and decided by the user:
   skillDmg (Forte Circuit mechanic bucket).
2. **Icon lookup bug**: `SKILL_ICONS['Shorekeeper']['Heavy Attack: Illation']` was too long to ever
   match `getSkillIcon()`'s `skillName.includes(key)` check against the real (short) rotation-step name
   `'Illation'` — the icon was silently never resolving. Shortened the key to `'Illation'`, exact same
   bug class already fixed for Xiangli Yao's `'Revamp'` key.

3. `weaponAlts.alt5` listed `["Firstlight's Herald", 'Cosmic Ripples']`, neither of which appears
   anywhere in this source. Initially left unchanged (flagged instead) pending confirmation the dump
   extraction was exhaustive — the user then confirmed the full raw Best Weapons table text matches
   this dump exactly, only 4 total options (signature + 3 4★s, no other 5★). Removed the alt5 key
   entirely (same "omit when no real 5★ alt exists" convention already used elsewhere), rather than an
   empty array.

6 new/updated tests (Flare Star Butterfly ×2, icon lookup), full suite green (1438/1438). rawDps moved
from ~1254 to include the new Butterfly damage (engine/legacy ratio now 1.015, previously exact parity
— the Stage 1 harness doesn't fold this new engine-only damage into the legacy comparison path, a known,
expected divergence for any character whose engine block set now models MORE than the legacy flat table
does).

**2026-09-09 full kit audit** (independent re-derivation, zero deference to the pass above — re-verified
all 3 prior fixes still hold; cross-checked `CHARACTER_DATA`, `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`, `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA`,
`SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`, `SKILL_ICONS`, `SEQUENCE_NAMES`, `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`, `dmgFocus`, and `teams`
fresh against this dump — all still match exactly). No new bugs found. Specifically investigated:

- **Illation's `heavyDmg` category**: confirmed correct — SKILL_MULTIPLIERS' own row explicitly labels
  it "Illation, Heavy ATK", and the kit text's own Forte Circuit description calls the input "casting
  Heavy Attack", matching the default-to-input-button convention with no "considered X DMG" override.
- **Base Intro Enlightenment being entirely unmodeled**: confirmed deliberate, not a gap — the modeled
  `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS` step is `Discernment` (the empowered variant), matching this dump's own
  "Standard Rotation" (a repeating loop assuming Supernal Stellarealm is already up from a prior cycle);
  Enlightenment only fires on a cold, Supernal-not-yet-reached first loop, which isn't the rotation this
  file models — same "legitimately unused in the modeled rotation" precedent as Sanhua's Basic Attack V
  / Rover: Havoc's Basic ATK combo.
- **Inherent Skill "Self Gravitation"'s cross-character Rover Energy Regen buff**: confirmed correctly
  unmodeled — this engine's DPS-focused stat schema doesn't track Energy Regen as a damage-affecting
  stat at all (a structural limitation applied uniformly to every character's Concerto/Energy-generation
  effects in this codebase, not something specific to Shorekeeper needing its own flag).
- **`shorekeeper.chain.s6-to-the-new-world`'s dual totalMult/critDmg scoping**: confirmed both effects
  correctly apply only to `shorekeeper.intro.discernment`'s own hit (no other block shares its
  `Intro:Discernment` trigger key, so no leak risk).

No code changes this pass. Full suite unaffected (1889/1889).
