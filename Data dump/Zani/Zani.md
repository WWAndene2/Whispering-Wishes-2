## Kit

### Active skills — Routine Negotiation

**Basic Attack**: up to 4 attacks, Spectro DMG. After Stage 3, press timed → Breakthrough → Stage 4
(also reachable via a timed Dodge after Stage 3).
**Heavy Attack**: consumes STA, Spectro DMG. Timed press → Basic Stage 3.
**Mid-air Attack**: consumes STA, plunging attack, Spectro DMG. Timed press → Basic Stage 3.
**Dodge Counter**: after successful Dodge, Spectro DMG. Timed press → Breakthrough (or Stage 4 directly
if Breakthrough missed).

**Multipliers (Lv.10):**
| Move | Multiplier |
|---|---|
| Stage 1 DMG | 58.85% |
| Stage 2 DMG | 79.53% |
| Stage 3 DMG | 42.42%×3 |
| Stage 4 DMG | 67.60%×4 |
| Breakthrough DMG | 61.50% + 17.58%×7 |
| Heavy Attack DMG | 41.08%×4 |
| Plunging Attack DMG | 104.98% |
| Dodge Counter DMG | 74.23%×3 |

### Resonance Skill — Restless Watch

**Standard Defense Protocol**: attack + block stance (ends early if swapped off). Timed press → Basic
Stage 3 (+10 Redundant Energy, Stagnates target). Blocking a hit → -100% that instance, Stagnates
nearby, casts Pinpoint Strike (Spectro DMG, -5% target Vibration Strength, self -30% DMG taken 2s).
**Crisis Response Protocol** (replaces base Skill at 100 Redundant Energy, outside Inferno Mode): hold
→ interruption-immune Ready Stance. Release/timeout → consumes all Redundant Energy for **Targeted
Action** (Spectro DMG). Hit during Ready Stance → -100% that hit, consumes all Redundant Energy for
**Forcible Riposte** (Spectro DMG, Stagnates, -5% Vibration Strength, self -30% DMG taken 2s). Either
cast → 1 Heliacal Ember stack + Blaze + enters **Sunburst** (+20% Spectro Frazzle DMG to target).

| | |
|---|---|
| Standard Defense Protocol DMG | 63.94% |
| Pinpoint Strike DMG | 61.00% + 121.99% |
| Targeted Action DMG | 86.19% + 28.73% + 172.37% |
| Forcible Riposte DMG | 86.19% + 28.73% + 172.37% |
| Standard Defense Protocol Cooldown | 5s |
| Sunburst Duration | 14s |

### Resonance Liberation — Between Dawn and Dusk

**Rekindle**: Spectro DMG, enters Inferno Mode — Max Blaze 100→150, grants 50 Blaze, Basic Attack DMG
Multiplier increased.
**The Last Stand** (available in Inferno Mode when Blaze < 30, or after 8s in Inferno Mode): Spectro
DMG, ends Inferno Mode.

| | |
|---|---|
| Rekindle DMG | 318.52% |
| The Last Stand ("Judgement Day") DMG | 191.12% + 1082.96% |
| Basic Attack Multiplier Increase (Inferno) | 25% |
| Cooldown | 25s |
| Resonance Cost | 125 |
| Inferno Mode Duration | 20s |

### Forte Circuit — There Will Be A Light

**Heliacal Ember**: while Zani is in the team, a nearby teammate's Spectro Frazzle application is
instantly consumed and converted 1:1 into Heliacal Ember (cap 60, 6s/stack), granting Blaze. Counts
toward Spectro Frazzle for Eternal Radiance's Sonata effect.

**Scorching Light** (replaces Standard Defense Protocol when Blaze > 30, in Inferno Mode): Heavy Slash
- Daybreak/Dawning/Nightfall/Lightsmash become available, considered both Heavy Attack DMG AND Spectro
Frazzle DMG. Hold Skill → Ready Stance (interruption-immune, ends early if swapped off); release →
Heavy Slash - Daybreak (consumes Blaze). Hit during Ready Stance → -100% that hit, Stagnates nearby,
casts Heavy Slash - Lightsmash (consumes Blaze, -10% Vibration Strength, self -30% DMG taken 2s). After
Lightsmash or when Ready Stance ends → Basic Attack auto-replaced by Heavy Slash - Nightfall (consumes
up to 40 Blaze, each point boosting its Multiplier). After Daybreak (>30 Blaze remaining) → Basic
Attack → Heavy Slash - Dawning (consumes Blaze). After Dawning → Basic Attack → Nightfall.

**Redundant Energy** (cap 100, not gained in Inferno Mode): Normal Attack hits, Intro hits, Standard
Defense Protocol cast, Pinpoint Strike cast.

**Blaze**: cap 100 outside Inferno Mode, 150 inside. Daybreak consumes 10, Dawning 20, Nightfall up to
40 (full pass = 70). Targeted Action/Forcible Riposte grant 10. Each Heliacal Ember conversion grants 5
Blaze/stack. Rekindle grants 50.

| | |
|---|---|
| Heavy Slash - Daybreak DMG | 198.81% |
| Heavy Slash - Dawning DMG | 424.07% |
| Heavy Slash - Nightfall DMG | 135.20% + 262.43% |
| Additional Multiplier Per Blaze (Nightfall) | 9.95% |
| Heavy Slash - Lightsmash DMG | 424.07% |
| Max Heliacal Ember Stacks | 60 |
| Heliacal Ember Duration Per Stack | 6s |

### Inherent Skills
- **Quick Response**: Intro cast grants +12% Spectro DMG Bonus for 14s.
- **Fear No Pain**: in Ready Stance, all DMG taken -40%.

### Intro Skill — Immediate Execution
Spectro DMG. Multiplier: 24.24%×5 + 80.80%. Concerto Regen 10.

### Outro Skill — Beacon For the Future
Spectro DMG = 150% ATK, removes all Heliacal Ember stacks on target (+10% DMG per stack consumed),
considered Spectro Frazzle DMG. Other teammates' Spectro DMG to the Heliacal-Ember-marked target
Amplified +20% for 20s.

### Resonance Chain (Dupes)
- **S1**: Targeted Action/Forcible Riposte cast → +50% Spectro DMG Bonus for 14s. Immune to
  interruption casting Heavy Slash - Nightfall.
- **S2**: Crit Rate +20%. Targeted Action/Forcible Riposte's DMG Multiplier +80%.
- **S3**: In Inferno Mode, each Blaze consumed → The Last Stand's DMG Multiplier +8%, capped +1200%.
- **S4**: Intro cast → whole team ATK +20% for 30s.
- **S5**: Rekindle's DMG Multiplier +120%.
- **S6**: Heavy Slash Daybreak/Dawning/Nightfall/Lightsmash DMG Multipliers +40%. Each Blaze consumed
  → Nightfall's DMG Multiplier +40% on hit. In Inferno Mode: if Blaze < 70, instantly restore 70
  (once/Inferno Mode); within 8s of entering Inferno Mode, survive a fatal blow with 1 HP.

### Minor Fortes (Total)
Crit Rate +8%, ATK% +12%.

### Stats (Lv.90, incl. minor fortes)
HP 10775 / ATK 438 / DEF 1137 / Max Energy 125 / Crit Rate 5% / Crit DMG 150% / Spectro DMG 0%.

## Review

- DPS Tier: T1.5 (Tower of Adversity), T2 (Whimpering Wastes). Value Tier: T2 / T2.
- **Pros**: very high baseline Cleave damage with Ultimate Swap Cancel upside; easy to use (tanky +
  simple combos); deals Frazzle AND Heavy Attack DMG simultaneously (many buff options); can parry to
  enhance combos and stun faster; looks great in Ultimate stance.
- **Cons**: expensive to max out (needs Phoebe for massive DMG Amp/RES Shred, both her and Zani's
  signatures contribute); full combos need enough Frazzle to max Blaze (currently only Confession
  Phoebe delivers this reliably) — locks her into one team archetype.
- Spectro Gauntlets DPS specializing in Inferno Mode (her Ultimate stance). Converts teammates' Spectro
  Frazzle into Heliacal Ember instantly to charge Blaze (needed for her combos). Good Cleave range,
  damage resistance, and built-in parries make her tanky while hitting hard.
- Blaze (cap 150 in Inferno): Ultimate entry (+50), enhanced Skill Crisis Response Protocol (+10),
  Heliacal Ember conversion (+5/stack). She cannot apply Frazzle herself — entirely teammate-dependent.
  Heliacal Ember is a Frazzle variant (cap 60) that doesn't benefit from Frazzle-specific buffs (Rover:
  Spectro's Shimmer, Confession Phoebe's extension rate, Absolution Phoebe's Starflash Amp) except
  Eternal Radiance's Sonata trigger — but its damage is instant and equal to what the Frazzle
  would've dealt.
  Redundant Energy (100, outside Ultimate) fuels Crisis Response Protocol via Basic Attacks/Standard
  Defense Protocol/Intro. A successful parry (Pinpoint Strike) speeds this up; without one, Intro →
  Standard Defense Protocol → Basic 3 (+ Basic 4 if hits miss) is usually enough.
- Inferno Mode: new Basic Attacks (Daybreak/Dawning/Nightfall), a new parry Skill/Dodge Counter
  (Lightsmash), Blaze-fueled. All Inferno damage counts as BOTH Heavy Attack AND Spectro Frazzle DMG.
  Full rotation: 140 Blaze needed (Enhanced Skill's 10 + Ultimate's 50 = 90 base, requiring 18 Frazzle
  converted — but her main combo only needs 140 total, i.e. 16 Frazzle). +25% Basic Attack Multiplier
  in Inferno only applies to her UNCONVERTED Basic Attacks (ignorable, since Forte-replaced attacks
  don't benefit).
  Simplest rotation: the Daybreak→Dawning→Nightfall string, twice (140 Blaze). Alternative: parry
  (Lightsmash, 20 Blaze) or Dodge Counter into Nightfall for a cheaper 60-Blaze combo if Blaze
  generation is inconsistent.
  The Last Stand (2nd Ultimate, available at ≤30 Blaze or after 8s in Inferno) ends the rotation — may
  deal less than a fully-buffed Nightfall since Frazzle/Heavy DMG buffs don't apply to it.
- Outro: final Frazzle-DMG burst scaling with Heliacal Ember stacks on the target, consumes them, +20%
  Spectro DMG Amp to allies hitting the marked target (small Support boost, limited further use).
- Biggest weakness: near-total reliance on Confession Phoebe (only character that reliably fully feeds
  her Frazzle needs — also grants 100% Frazzle DMG Amp on Outro, +30% more with her signature). Still
  functions without Phoebe via high baseline damage, but loses significant potential. Team comps stay
  restrictive (needs a Frazzle applier + Zani + a generalist Support as her core, little flexibility).

## Build

**Best Weapon**: Blazing Justice (R1, signature) — ATK+12%; Basic Attack cast → ignore 8% target DEF +
Amplify Spectro Frazzle DMG +50% for 6s (retrigger resets duration). 100%. Alts: Tragicomedy 93.7%
(Roccia's signature — all her Inferno attacks count as Basic Attack casts for its passive, giving 48%
Heavy DMG Bonus), Verity's Handle 85.0% (Xiangli Yao's signature, Liberation-focused, low synergy),
Pulsation Bracer 80.5% (best permanent), Moongazer's Sigil 77.2%, Abyss Surges 72.6% (best permanent
2nd choice, huge ATK), Aether Strike 69.3% (best 4★, Battle Pass), Celestial Spiral 67.7%, Stonard
66.1%, Hollow Mirage 62.9%, Legend of Drunken Hero (F2P last resort — Heliacal Ember doesn't count as a
Negative Status, so its passive only helps with Ciaccona/Chisa on team).

**Best Echo Set**: Eternal Radiance — 2pc: +10% Spectro DMG; 5pc: inflicting Frazzle → +20% Crit Rate
for 15s; hitting a 10-stack Frazzle target → +15% Spectro DMG Bonus for 15s. Best-in-slot for any
Frazzle-inflicting DPS. Main Echo: Capitaneus (+12% Spectro + 12% Heavy Attack DMG Bonus in main slot)
vs. Nightmare: Mourning Aix (+12% Spectro DMG, +100% Echo Skill DMG vs Frazzle targets) — both viable.

**Substats priority**: Energy Regen (until satisfied) > Crit Rate = Crit DMG > ATK% > ATK.

**Endgame stat targets (Lv.90)**: HP 15000+, DEF 1100+, ATK 1800-2300+, Crit Rate 65%+ (before Echo set
bonuses), Crit DMG 210-260%+, Energy Regen 115%+ (lower in Quickswap), Spectro DMG Bonus 50-80%+.

**Skill priority**: Forte Circuit > Liberation > Skill > Intro > Basic Attack.

## Gameplay and Teams

**Standard DPS Rotation**: Intro → Skill: Standard Def Protocol → Basic P3 → Skill: Targeted Action →
Ultimate: Rekindle → Forte: Heavy Slash Daybreak → Dawning → Nightfall (×2 full passes) → Ultimate: The
Last Stand → Outro.

**Double Intro DPS Rotation** (cuts 2 hard-to-land hits, costs a teammate's Intro use): Intro → swap →
Intro → Skill: Targeted Action → Ultimate: Rekindle → Forte: Heavy Slash Daybreak → Dawning → Nightfall
(×2) → Ultimate: The Last Stand → Outro.

**Synergies**: Phoebe (Confession mode — the perfect partner: 100% DMG Amplification, supportive
Moonlit Clouds set option, fully fills Blaze via Frazzle — no other teammate compares). Rover:
Spectro/Ciaccona (other Frazzle appliers — 2 appliers let her land 3 Nightfalls/rotation; Phoebe +
Spectro Rover is the best team when fully optimized, Ciaccona a worse alternative). Iuno/Phrolova/
Mortefi (Heavy ATK DMG Amp via Outro — none matches Phoebe's 100%; Phrolova has high personal damage,
Mortefi is F2P with higher buffing, Iuno is a sustain-focused middle ground). Shorekeeper/Verina (best
generalist option for non-Quickswap teams — high team ATK%, 15% DMG Amp, Crit buffs; more sustain than
Spectro Rover).

**Example Teams**: Team #1 Best Team, Team #2 Premium Alternatives, Team #3 F2P Team — exact roster
icons weren't machine-readable in this extraction; inferred from the Synergies section text (Phoebe +
Rover: Spectro is explicitly named "the best Zani team when fully optimized").

**Calculation Notes**: S2 gains more value from a Crit DMG main echo. S6 grants extra Blaze, enabling 3
Forte-empowered Basic sequences instead of 2 — adjust rotation/play accordingly (Post-S6 rotation time:
16.34s).

## Damage Profile (calc, solo, no team buffs)
Heavy 56.3% (221,626) / Liberation 24.9% (98,268) / Skill (22,666) / Outro (19,309) / Intro 4.9%
(11,949) / Echo (11,949) / Basic 3% (8,212). Rotation time 12.64s. S0: 1,022,882 DMG (80,924 DPS).

## App Data Comparison (vs. `app/src/data/characters.js` + `zani.blocks.js`)

No dump file existed before this pass — created. `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA`/`CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`/
`bestWeapon`/`bestEchoes`/`weaponAlts` values already matched this source exactly.

**Real bugs found and fixed**:
1. **4 rotation-lookup gaps, all sourced with real data now** (previously flagged in
   `data-integrity.test.js`'s `KNOWN_UNRESOLVED_BASELINE` as known-but-unresolved silent-0-DMG steps):
   `Skill: Standard Defense Protocol` had no `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS` row at all (added, 63.94%); `Skill:
   Targeted Action / Forcible Riposte` never substring-matched the old shorter `'Targeted Action'` row
   name (renamed, using Forcible Riposte's identical real value); the 3 `'Heavy Slash <Name>'` rows
   (no colon) never matched the real rotation steps `'Heavy Slash: <Name>'` (with colon) — added
   colons + a new combined row for the repeated-string 2nd-pass step; `Basic ATK: Stage 3` never
   substring-matched the combined `'Stage 1-4'` row — added its own dedicated row (127.3%, matching
   what the engine block already used).
2. Also resolved a long-standing TODO: Daybreak/Dawning's exact Blaze costs (10/20) were previously
   "commonly-cited, not independently confirmed" — this source's Review text states them explicitly.
3. `zani.skill.targeted-action` had no `damage.category` — resolves to `skillDmg` (a Resonance Skill
   cast with no override text). This also silently blocked `chain.s2`'s `skillDmg` effect from ever
   matching even after its own trigger fix.
4. `chain.s2`, `chain.s3`, `chain.s5` were all `kind:'buff'` with `trigger:{type:'cast',...}` and no
   `timing.duration` — the item-12 dead-buff architecture bug — silent no-ops. Fixed via
   `trigger:{type:'passive'}` + `scopedToBlockId` (S3/S5 both needed scoping since `libDmg` is shared
   between Rekindle and The Last Stand — without it, either fix would have cross-bled onto the wrong
   Liberation cast).
5. `teams` led with `'Zani + Phoebe + Shorekeeper'` — the source's own Synergies text explicitly calls
   `Phoebe + Spectro Rover` "the best Zani team when fully optimized" (Shorekeeper is named separately
   as best for non-Quickswap teams) — reordered to lead with the source's own "best" framing.

7 new/rewritten tests, full suite green (1329/1329).

## Full kit audit — 2026-09-09

Independent re-audit (did not trust the prior pass's own claims — re-read this dump, `zani.blocks.js`,
the existing test file, and every relevant `characters.js` table from scratch). Cross-checked
`CHARACTER_DATA`, `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`, `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA` (including its own detailed audit comment,
re-read directly rather than trusted), `SKILL_MULTIPLIERS`, `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`, `SKILL_ICONS`, and
`SEQUENCE_NAMES` against this dump.

**3 real bugs found and fixed**:

1. **Chain S3/S5's `scopedToBlockId` targets were swapped backwards**, apparently since the 2026-09-03
   dead-buff fix first wrote them. Real kit text (this dump, and independently confirmed by
   `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Zani']`'s own audit comment in `characters.js`): S3 is **The Last Stand's**
   approximated per-Blaze scaling multiplier (real effect +8%/Blaze consumed, capped +1200%,
   conservatively modeled as a flat +200%); S5 is **Rekindle's** own confirmed-exact +120%. The code had
   S3 scoped to `zani.liberation.rekindle` and S5 scoped to `zani.liberation.the-last-stand` — exactly
   backwards, silently boosting the wrong Liberation cast for both nodes at sequence 3 and sequence 5.
   Fixed by swapping both `scopedToBlockId` values. The existing test (`triggerEngine-zani.test.js`) had
   its own assertions written to match the swapped, wrong behavior — corrected to assert the real
   pairing instead.
2. **Chain S4 was `trigger:{type:'passive'}`** (an unconditional, always-on team ATK+20%), with its own
   note claiming "no specific cast anchor sourced" — false, contradicted by data already present in the
   same file: `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Zani']`'s own audit comment states "s4 team +20% ATK **on Intro
   cast** confirmed correct", and this dump is explicit: "S4: **Intro cast** → whole team ATK +20% for
   **30s**." Retargeted to a real `cast`-triggered, 30s-duration, refresh-stacking buff. Measured
   directly: zero DPS change for the standard modeled rotation (it totals ~16.5s, well within the 30s
   window opened by the opening Intro cast) — a correctness/robustness fix, not one that moves the
   currently-computed numbers, but it matters for any future custom/longer rotation.
3. **`CHARACTER_DATA['Zani']`'s structured debuffs column (4th element of its dmgFocus/buffs/debuffs
   row) was `['Frazzle']`**, directly contradicting this dump's own repeated, explicit emphasis: "She
   cannot apply Frazzle herself — entirely teammate-dependent." `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Zani'].debuffs` (the
   functional DOT-detection array `calcTeamStats.js` actually reads for Frazzle/Erosion/FusionBurst
   mechanics) was already correctly `[]`; this structured column instead feeds the UI's own "Debuffs
   Applied" team-summary list (`allDebuffs`, rendered directly in `DamageCalculator.jsx`) — a real,
   user-visible bug that would have told a player Zani applies Frazzle, when her entire kit identity is
   built around NOT being able to and needing a teammate who does. Fixed to `[]`.

**1 genuine gap newly found, left unmodeled (not invented)**: Chain S6's real kit text has a **third**
component beyond the already-modeled flat +40% Heavy Slash DMG Multiplier: "Each Blaze consumed →
Nightfall's DMG Multiplier +40% on hit" — a separate, per-Blaze-consumed scaling bonus specific to
Nightfall, stacking on top of both the flat +40% AND Nightfall's own already-unmodeled base kit
+9.95%/Blaze. This was missed entirely by every prior pass (the existing `RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA` comment
explicitly — and, per this finding, wrongly — claimed "heavyDmg:40 above already fully represents s6's
only damage-relevant effect"). Same "per-unit-of-a-consumable-resource scaling, no schema field" class
as S3, but unlike S3, no conservative rotation-representative estimate has been derived for this
component — flagging it honestly (documented in both `characters.js` and `zani.blocks.js`) rather than
inventing an unsourced number. This could matter meaningfully for sequence-6 DPS and should be revisited
in a future pass, ideally with a derived conservative estimate matching S3's approach or the Phase 2
per-resource-point-scaling schema extension this file already TODOs for S3.

3 new/updated tests, full suite green (1897/1897). No golden fixture changes needed — all 3 fixes are
either sequence-gated (S3/S5 only activate at sequence ≥3/≥5, both above the golden fixture's tested
sequence 0) or UI-display-only (the debuffs column), and S4's fix measured zero DPS change at the
sequences it does apply to; confirmed by the full suite staying green with no drift, not assumed.

## frazzleDmg category built (direct user request)

The user explicitly asked for a real, engine-wide `frazzleDmg` stat category to be built, after an
audit surfaced that Phoebe's own kit already solves the same *single-category* Frazzle-Amp shape via
`scopedToBlockId` (no new category needed there). Zani's own Sunburst mechanic, however, needed genuine
dual-categorization support: her Heavy Slash combo is "counted as BOTH Heavy Attack AND Spectro Frazzle
DMG" simultaneously, which a single `damage.category` string can't express.

**Engine changes** (documented-gaps sweep, not specific to any one character):
- `categories.js`: registered `frazzleDmg` as a real category.
- `calcEngine.js`: added `frazzleDmg` to `createStats()`'s accumulator and a `case 'frazzleDmg'` to
  `applyBuff()`'s switch — mirrors `coordDmg`/`outroDmg` exactly.
- `block.schema.js`/`validate.js`: added an optional `damage.secondaryCategory`/`proc.secondaryCategory`
  field — a SECOND, additive category a hit can also carry alongside its primary `category`, for
  genuinely dual-categorized hits. Purely additive/opt-in.
- `resolveHitComposedDps.js`/`resolveHitComposedTeamDps.js`: the `categoryStat` calculation now sums
  `stats[category] + stats[secondaryCategory]` (when present) instead of reading just one category —
  backward-compatible by construction, since `secondaryCategory` defaults to `undefined` for every
  existing block. Verified via 2 new synthetic unit tests in `resolveHitComposedDps.test.js` (dual-bonus
  additivity, and byte-identical behavior for a block with no `secondaryCategory`).

**Zani's own fix**: added `zani.selfbuff.sunburst` (a real, cast-triggered, 14s-duration `frazzleDmg+20`
buff, firing 3× in her real modeled rotation on Targeted Action/Forcible Riposte casts — previously
entirely unmodeled, since no `frazzleDmg` stat existed to model it with). Tagged her 4 real Heavy Slash
blocks (Daybreak/Dawning/Nightfall/2nd-pass) with `damage.secondaryCategory: 'frazzleDmg'`, and corrected
her Outro (`zani.outro.beacon-for-the-future`) from uncategorized to `category: 'frazzleDmg'` directly
(a single category there, not dual — her kit text says the Outro hit is "counted as Spectro Frazzle
DMG" alone). Added the same buff to `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Zani'].selfBuffs` for data-layer consistency
(inert for her own DPS calc, same reasoning as Youhu's Rare Find — she's fully block-converted).

Measured directly: this is a REAL, live DPS increase (not sequence-gated like S3/S5) — `legacyRawDps`/
`engineDps` rose 2401 → 2574/2574 (a real, previously-missing self-buff, not double-counting anything).
Golden fixtures regenerated via the established `DUMP_GOLDEN` pattern; reason logged in
`phase3-parityGolden.test.js`'s own header-comment log. Stat-panel golden (avgCrit/score) unaffected —
frazzleDmg doesn't touch crit stats.

Also reviewed Phoebe's `phoebe.outro.confession-frazzle-amp` (a cross-character "+100% Frazzle DMG Amp
to the incoming ally" buff) as a candidate second beneficiary of the new category — left unchanged: it
would need the RECEIVING ally's own blocks to be frazzleDmg-tagged, which no character's kit has been
audited for, and the block never fires in her modeled rotation anyway (stays in Absolution mode), so
there's no live number to correct. Documented the new option there for a future revisit.

4 new/updated tests (2 synthetic resolver tests + Zani's own Sunburst test + the pre-existing suite),
full suite green (1900/1900). Golden fixtures regenerated (see above) — the one real, live-DPS-affecting
change from this whole documented-gaps sweep.

## S6 Nightfall-per-Blaze gap fixed (direct user follow-up)

The remaining, previously-flagged S6 gap: her kit text — "Each Blaze consumed → Nightfall's DMG
Multiplier +40% on hit" — mirrors S3's per-point phrasing exactly ("each Blaze consumed → The Last
Stand's DMG Multiplier +8%, capped +1200%") but gives no stated cap. Read literally as a per-Blaze rate
over Nightfall's own up-to-40-Blaze consumption, this would be **+1600%** — implausible next to every
other dupe bonus on her kit or across the roster (nothing else is remotely that large).

Flagged this ambiguity to the user explicitly rather than guessing between a ~40x-different outcome.
**Decided**: model "+40%" as the already-total flat value (not a per-point rate), consistent with
typical dupe power levels elsewhere. Added `zani.chain.s6-nightfall-mult` (`heavyDmg+40`, scoped via
`scopedToBlockId` to `zani.forte.heavy-slash-nightfall` and `zani.forte.heavy-slash-string-2nd-pass`).

**Known, disclosed limitation**: the combined 2nd-pass block bundles Daybreak+Dawning+Nightfall's hits
into one block id (the real rotation collapses the 2nd pass into a single step), so this schema can't
scope the bonus to just Nightfall's own hits WITHIN that block — the 2nd pass's Daybreak/Dawning portion
receives a small over-credit as a result. Documented inline; same class of approximation already
accepted elsewhere in this file for combined multi-move blocks.

Measured directly: Nightfall's own damage rises with the new block present vs. absent (confirmed via
`with6`/`without6` comparison at sequence 6), and Daybreak's own standalone block is correctly
unaffected. Sequence-gated (S6 only), so this does NOT move the golden fixture's tested sequence-0
baseline — confirmed by the full suite staying green with no drift. 1 new test added, full suite green
(1901/1901).
