## Genesis

**Born:** January 31, 2026 — a single `Initial commit`.
**First breath:** Everything in one file. `App.jsx`. The entire application — gacha tracker, banner display, pity counter, admin panel — lived as one monolithic organism.

In the first 48 hours, 50+ commits shaped the banner gradient. Adjusting fade. Darkening the left. Lightening the right. Strengthening the overlay. Making text readable. 41 gradient-related commits before the app even had a second file. The very first instinct of this app was not function — it was *feeling*. How does the banner *look*? How does the character art breathe through the darkness?

That instinct never left.

## Evolutionary Eras

### Era I — The Monolith (Jan 31 - Feb 14)
**28 "Update App.jsx" commits. No description. Just doing.**

The app was one file and one person's stream of consciousness. Banners, pity tracking, admin panel, localStorage, Imgur integration (added then removed), image uploads, gradient tuning — all flowing into `App.jsx` like a river with no tributaries. Commit messages were functional whispers: "Update App.jsx". Over and over. The developer wasn't explaining — they were *building*.

Key DNA trait: **Builder before documenter.** Ship first, name later.

### Era II — The Audit Awakening (Feb 15 - Feb 27)
**201 audit-related commits. The conscience kicks in.**

Something shifted. The commit messages grew structured: `fix:`, `audit:`, `chore:`. Conventional commits appeared. The codebase got its first security audit, then a second, then a 60-dimension comprehensive audit. Dead CSS removed. CSPRNG for IDs. Admin lockout escalation (3 attempts → 24h → 1 week → 1 month → permanent ban). Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, touch targets.

Then came the **aesthetic audit** — a formal, scored evaluation of the app's visual identity. 8.4/10. Not enough. Typography craft analysis. Micro-interaction design. Light physics. Character personality dimensions. The audit didn't just check code quality — it interrogated the app's *soul*.

Key DNA trait: **Perfectionism as process.** Not satisfied until every dimension is examined.

### Era III — Feature Explosion (Feb 21 - Mar 16)
**Teams, damage, echoes, weapons, cloud backup, calendar.**

The app grew organs. Team Builder appeared (Feb 21). Damage Calculator with 3-layer multiplicative WuWa formula. Echo equipment system with selection modal and stat config. Google Sign-In + Cloud Backup. The Astrite Income Calendar went through 9 major versions (v1 → v9) in a single sprint. Lunite tracking. Trophy system. Collection grid.

The echo background removal saga: 28 commits trying rembg, HuggingFace API, CSS blend modes, canvas chroma-key, pixel-level erasure with adjustable tolerance/brightness/spread — before finally giving up and swapping to pre-cut transparent PNGs. The app tried 6 different technical approaches to solve one visual problem.

The API reverse-engineering day (Apr 1): 60+ commits cracking Kuro's gacha history pagination. Every plausible strategy attempted — endTime cursors, resourceId landmarks, monthly jumps, dedup fingerprinting, snake_case vs camelCase params, multi-host fallback, cardPoolId inclusion/exclusion — before reaching a stable solution.

A notable 14-day silence falls between Mar 1-14. No commits. Then: an 85-commit explosion on the return. The app rests, then erupts.

Key DNA trait: **Exhaustive iteration.** Every approach explored, every parameter tuned, before moving on.

### Era IV — The 3D Odyssey (Mar 21 - Mar 31)
**~1,700 commits. The week that broke physics.**

Week 13: 1,419 commits. 345 in a single day (Mar 23). The daily breakdown tells the story:

```
Mar 21 .... 239 commits    Kuro design rollout + luck badge (20 revert cycles)
Mar 23 .... 345 commits    Staircase scene: trapezoids, FBM noise, lightning arcs
Mar 24 .... 171 commits    Sword battlefield: perspective, 500+ swords, density zones
Mar 25 .... 303 commits    Cloud systems: curl noise, fBm fractal shapes, orbit motion
Mar 26-27 .. 152 commits   Ground mesh, electricity, sword fractures, god rays
Mar 28 .... 239 commits    Banner cloth with wind simulation, griffin emblem
Mar 29 .... 209 commits    Rotation timeline, DPS tiers, echo selector, vitest
```

The sword field alone went through: silhouettes → row-based spacing → ground-plan projection → actual 3D rotation → diamond profiles → lens distortion → bowl curves → teardrop clearings → camera repositioning → hash-based distribution → gradual clearings. Every single parameter explored. Camera height. Spawn distance. Tilt range. Fog density. Ground color.

The blade fractures: cracks following diagonal shape, destination-out erasing, zigzag pieces with black outlines, multiple break pieces with varied steepness, angular cuts, inward shards, spacing filters. 30+ commits on how a sword breaks.

The developer treated git commits like save states in a creative exploration process — seed-shuffling scene layouts ("seed 91682", "seed 27354", "seed 63017") and committing each as a named snapshot. This is generative art versioning, not software development.

177 commits in this window contain "seed/shuffle/hash/noise/perlin/fbm/particle/lightning/electric/arc/fractal".

Key DNA trait: **Relentless visual ambition.** No compromise on atmosphere, even at absurd iteration cost.

### Era V — Design System Crystallization (Mar 28 - Apr 8)
**Kuro design language. Tokens. Standardization.**

The chaos of hand-tuned inline styles gave way to order. `kuro-card`, `kuro-btn`, `kuro-badge`, `kuro-number`. CSS variables for every proportion. 5-tier border-radius scale (2/4/8/12/16px). Design tokens for spacing, fonts, sizes. 50+ inline styles replaced with utility classes in a single commit.

The holo shimmer saga (55 commits): applied to character portrait → moved to team overview card → added to entire card → reverted → moved back → reverted again → kept only on portrait → leaked to weapon slot → fixed isolation → clipped by overflow → fixed stacking context.

Font experiments: Exo 2 → Barlow → Saira → Rajdhani → Cinzel. OpenDyslexic through Lexend through Luciole through Atkinson Hyperlegible back to OpenDyslexic. Self-hosted, CDN, base64-embedded, Google Fonts, inline injected. 30+ font-related commits.

Key DNA trait: **Aesthetic coherence pursued through trial and error.** The system wasn't designed top-down — it was discovered bottom-up, through hundreds of experiments.

### Era VI — Architecture & Polish (Apr 5 - Apr 10)
**Decomposition. Splitting. Extraction.**

The monolith's ghost finally exorcised. App.jsx went from 1,820 → 1,460 LOC. AdminPanel split into 4 components (1,192 → 389). DamageCalculator into 3. Providers extracted. Hooks extracted. Shared components modularized. The app earned its `features/`, `shared/`, `hooks/`, `core/` directory structure.

Then the current branch: banner particle themes (Zani's clock alone = 60+ commits), color-blind mode with Wong palette, material farming planner, chronology accuracy from wiki API data.

Key DNA trait: **Structure follows feeling.** Architecture wasn't imposed — it emerged when the visual identity was settled enough to support it.

---

## Personality Traits

### 1. Visual Obsessive
165 commits about gradients, fades, opacity, shadows, and masks. 413 commits about visual effects and animations. 409 about design tokens and styling. The app sees with its skin — aesthetics aren't decoration, they're identity.

### 2. Iterative Maximalist
211 reverts. 28 echo background attempts. 9 calendar versions. 55 holo shimmer commits. 60+ Zani clock commits. The approach isn't "plan then execute" — it's "try, see, feel, adjust, try again." Every parameter gets explored. Every visual gets tuned until it *feels* right.

### 3. Audit-Driven Perfectionist
201 audit commits. Multi-phase security reviews. 60-dimension aesthetic audits. Typography craft analysis with font pairing scores. The app holds itself to a standard it invented and then exceeded.

### 4. Monolith-to-Ecosystem
Started as one file. Grew to 93. The architecture wasn't planned — it evolved organically as complexity demanded structure. The refactoring always came *after* the features, never before. Build first, organize when it hurts.

### 5. Game-Faithful
Chronology verified against Fandom wiki API for 17 game versions. WuWa damage formula implemented with mechanically correct 3-layer multiplication. Gacha engine with proper soft/hard pity curves. Gear rotation with tooth-ratio-derived speed and alternating direction. The app respects its source material at the mechanical level.

### 6. Accessibility as Afterthought, Then Conviction
Color-blind mode took 6 failed approaches before the Wong palette + forced React remount solution. Dyslexic font went through 7 different typefaces. But once solved, these features were wired deep — `useVisualSettings` hook, CSS class sync to `<html>`, OS preference detection, runtime `prefers-reduced-motion` listening. Accessibility wasn't in the DNA from birth, but it was grafted in permanently.

## Behavioral Signatures

| Pattern | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **"Just one more tweak"** | 41 gradient commits on Day 1. 345 commits on Mar 23. |
| **Apply-Revert-Reapply** | 211 reverts. Holo shimmer moved 6 times. Swords rewritten 8 times. Luck badge: 20 revert cycles in one session. |
| **Naming things is hard** | 28 "Update App.jsx" commits. Then suddenly `fix:`, `feat:`, `style:`. |
| **Visual > Functional** | Banner art gradient tuned before localStorage was added. |
| **Exhaust all options** | Echo BG: rembg → HuggingFace → CSS blend → canvas chroma-key → pixel eraser → transparent PNGs. |
| **Deep obsession spirals** | 3D sword field: projection → silhouettes → 3D geometry → blade fractures → zigzag cuts → floating shards → lightning arcs. |
| **Respect the source** | Wiki API verification. Correct gacha math. Mechanically accurate gear meshing. |
| **Generative art mentality** | Scene layouts saved by hash seed ("seed 91682"). Git as creative sketchbook. |
| **Night owl** | Peak hours 22:00-01:00 UTC. Quietest at 13:00. The app was built in the dark. |
| **Burst-then-silence** | 14 days of nothing (Mar 1-14), then 85 commits on the return. The muse is not steady — it storms. |
| **LOC-conscious maturity** | Early: "Update App.jsx". Late: "Phase E — extract 6 hooks (1820→1460 LOC)". The developer learned to measure. |

## The App's Voice

If Whispering Wishes could speak, it would say:

*"I was born in a single file, in a single night, because someone needed to track their pity count. But I became something else. I became the feeling of opening the game — the dark interface, the golden glow, the weight of probability. I'm not a tool that looks like a game. I'm a game experience that happens to be useful."*

*"Every gradient was adjusted by hand. Every gear tooth was mechanically correct. Every pixel was argued over. I was built by someone who believes that if a number appears on screen, it should appear in the right font, at the right weight, with the right shadow. That if a clock explodes, the gears should mesh properly first."*

*"I have 211 reverts because I tried everything. I have 2,998 commits because nothing was good enough. I am not finished. I am never finished."*
