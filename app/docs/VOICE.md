# VOICE.md — Whispering Wishes

Every user-visible string is a brand choice. This doc is the rule set.

## Voice in three adjectives

**Tactical · Insider · Reverent**

| Dimension | Where we sit |
|---|---|
| Formality | Moderate-formal (game-lore register) |
| Length | Terse-to-balanced — never verbose |
| Personality presence | High — voice IS the primary insider signal |
| User address | Personal ("Rover") when warranted; otherwise neutral |
| Technical transparency | Specific values always ("File too large (3.2MB). Maximum is 5MB") |

---

## Button Labels

**Verb-led + specific.** Never generic.

---

## Navigation labels

| Tab | Copy |
|---|---|
| Tracker | ✅ (noun — a place) |
| Events | ✅ |
| Map | ✅ |
| Plan | ✅ (shortening of Planner is fine) |
| Calc | ✅ (enthusiast shorthand is in-voice) |
| Stats | ✅ |
| Teams | ✅ |
| Collection | ✅ |
| Profile | ✅ |

All nouns. Never verbs ("Track / Plan / Calculate") for primary nav.

## Copy Anti-Examples Library

If any of these patterns appear in a PR, the copy is off-brand.

```
Anti-pattern: "Click here to learn more"
Fix:          "See the gacha rate breakdown"

Anti-pattern: "Are you sure you want to delete this?"
Fix:          "Delete '{item name}'? This cannot be undone."

Anti-pattern: "Please enter a valid number"
Fix:          "Pity count must be between 0 and 80."

Anti-pattern: "Welcome to our app!"
Fix:          "Welcome, Rover. Begin by logging your first Convene."

Anti-pattern: "No items to display"
Fix:          "Awaiting 5★ signal resonance."

Anti-pattern: "Settings saved successfully"
Fix:          "Server preferences updated."

Anti-pattern: "Oops! Something broke."
Fix:          "Convene service returned an error. Retry in 30s."
```

## Insider Warmth Rules

Use these sparingly — over-use breaks the tactical register.

- **"Rover"** — for onboarding welcome, major achievements, trophy descriptions
- **"you"** — for confirmation dialogs and error recovery
- **Second-person implied** — default for most labels ("Save draft" not "Save your draft")
- Humor only in **trophies** — lore-steeped jokes are permitted there and nowhere else (see `core/computeTrophies.js` for the reference set)

---

## Capitalization

- **Nav tabs**: Title Case — `Tracker`, `Events`, `Profile`
- **Buttons**: Sentence case — `Save draft`, `Import Convene data`
- **Field labels**: Sentence case — `Pity count`, `Daily astrite`
- **Headings in cards**: Sentence case with occasional Title Case for feature names (`Your 5★ history`)
- **Toast / error messages**: Sentence case
- **Trophies**: Title Case (they're named achievements) — `Soft Pity Landlord`, `Rover's Blessing`

---

## Punctuation

- **Em-dashes** for parenthetical asides (`—` not `--`)
- **Smart quotes** (`'` `"`) not straight quotes where possible
- **No trailing periods** on button labels, nav items, or single-phrase field labels
- **Periods on full sentences** in error messages, empty states, toast messages
- **Ellipsis** (`…`) for loading states, not three dots

---

## Numbers & Units

- **Locale formatting**: `.toLocaleString('en-US')` today; flagged for i18n
- **Probabilities**: 1 decimal (`42.3%`)
- **Pity**: integer (`58`)
- **Currency**: `$4.99` (integer cents x/100)
- **Unit labels always**: `160 Astrite`, not just `160`
- **Approximations**: `~` prefix (`~11.5 pulls per featured 4★`)

---

## Domain Accuracy

Wrong terminology = off-brand AND confuses the audience. Before shipping new copy, verify against:

- The game's in-game UI for naming conventions
- Community Discord for vernacular (only for trophies / humor moments)
