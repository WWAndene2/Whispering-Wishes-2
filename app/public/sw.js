// WHISPERING WISHES — Service Worker
// P14-FIX: HIGH-6 — Moved from inline blob URL to proper static file.
// Blob URL SWs bypass CSP, are invisible to security scanners, and prevent
// proper SW update lifecycle. A static file fixes all three issues.
// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// P26-FIX: bumped 3.5.0 -> 3.5.1 to force a real SW update. Browsers only
// re-run the `install` event (which is what actually refetches PRECACHE —
// manifest.webmanifest, index.html, etc. — from the network) when this
// file's own bytes change; editing PRECACHE'd files themselves does nothing
// on their own. The SET_VERSION postMessage handler below existed to keep
// this in sync with the app's real version, but nothing in src/ ever
// actually sent that message — a dead mechanism that let this drift
// indefinitely while every other fix silently kept serving a stale
// manifest.webmanifest to already-installed clients.
let APP_VERSION = '3.5.12';
let APP_CACHE = `ww-app-v${APP_VERSION}`;
let IMG_CACHE = `ww-images-v${APP_VERSION}`;

const MAX_IMG_ENTRIES = 250;

// Map-overlay tile cache — independent of APP_VERSION because tile URLs are
// stable across app deploys. Bumping TILE_CACHE_VERSION is the manual opt-in
// to force users to re-download tiles (e.g. if we re-slice an overlay).
// v2 -> v3: fetchTileWithRetry switched jsDelivr-routed tile downloads from
// no-cors to cors mode (opaque no-cors responses taint any canvas that
// later drawImage()s them, breaking MapTab.jsx's blur paint brush for every
// tile a device had ever offline-downloaded) - existing v2 caches may still
// hold opaque tiles fetched under the old mode, so this forces a clean
// re-fetch under the corrected mode instead of leaving stale opaque bytes
// in place indefinitely.
// v3 -> v4: Solaris_3's entire tile pyramid was regenerated from a master
// image with 552 paint strokes baked directly into it (see the "Bake paint
// strokes into Solaris_3" commit) - every z/y/x.webp tile's bytes changed,
// so devices need to re-fetch all of them rather than keep serving the
// pre-bake pixels from v3's cache indefinitely.
// v4 -> v5: the v4 bake only wrote the softening into Solaris_3's tiles -
// 400 of the 3232 stroke points actually fall inside Mengzhou's own
// footprint, where Mengzhou draws over Solaris and hides whatever's
// underneath, so those strokes had no visible effect at all until baked
// into Mengzhou.webp's own tile pyramid directly. Devices that already
// fetched Mengzhou's pre-bake tiles under v4 need a clean re-fetch.
// v5 -> v6: the v5 Mengzhou bake only baked points whose CENTER fell
// strictly inside Mengzhou's [0,natW]x[0,natH] rectangle - 634 of the
// dataset's points are centered just outside that rectangle but have a
// brush radius large enough to still paint onto Mengzhou's own edge, so
// their softening never reached Mengzhou's tiles at all (confirmed
// visually: a hard, un-softened straight edge on Mengzhou's own boundary
// even where a stroke's circle clearly overlapped it). Fixed to a
// radius-aware inclusion test. Devices need a clean re-fetch of
// Mengzhou's tiles again.
// v6 -> v7: the v6 Mengzhou blur bake blended the blurred composite's own
// alpha channel back into the master, not just its RGB. That composite is
// opaque wherever Solaris bleeds through behind Mengzhou's transparent
// ocean cutout, so any blur stroke crossing the cutout boundary punched a
// hard, brush-radius-shaped patch of full opacity into the cutout's smooth
// contour - visually indistinguishable from Mengzhou's old, un-softened
// cutout edge "clipping" back in on top of the new blur. Fixed so blur
// strokes only ever blend RGB and never touch Mengzhou's own alpha shape.
// Devices need a clean re-fetch of Mengzhou's tiles again.
// v7 -> v8: two more fixes at the Solaris/Mengzhou seam. (1) Solaris's own
// composite-based blur bake (baking the visible seam onto Solaris, not
// Mengzhou) weighted each stroke's blend only by brush-radius falloff, never
// by how much Mengzhou actually covers that pixel - so wherever a stroke's
// circle crossed Mengzhou's placement but Mengzhou itself is transparent
// there (won't render live), Solaris kept a "ghost" patch of Mengzhou-tinted
// blur floating in open ocean with nothing drawn over it. Now weighted by
// Mengzhou's own alpha too, so it self-limits to exactly where Mengzhou will
// actually render. (2) Mengzhou's right edge is a raw crop boundary (its
//16384px-wide source had to be cropped by 1px to fit WebP's hard limit) -
// not a coastline - so content was cut off there with zero falloff, a hard
// vertical cliff in both Mengzhou's own tiles and, via the composite, in
// Solaris's baked seam. Tapered that edge's alpha to transparent over its
// final ~200 world-px (matching the ~200px brush radius already used near
// it) instead of presenting a fabricated or hard-clipped coastline. Devices
// need a clean re-fetch of both Mengzhou's and Solaris's tiles again.
// v8 -> v9: the v8 edge taper (~200 world-px) was wide enough to visibly eat
// into the actual landmass shape near the crop boundary - the peninsula's
// tip read as truncated, not just softer-edged (reported directly: "the tip
// is not the shape it is supposed to be"). Narrowed the taper to ~6 world-px
// - just enough to avoid a literal single-pixel-wide hard line, without
// fading out real terrain detail. The boundary still reads as an edge at
// normal zoom (there's genuinely no more source art beyond it), but the
// shape itself is no longer eaten into. Devices need a clean re-fetch of
// both Mengzhou's and Solaris's tiles again.
// v9 -> v10: v9's ~6px taper was too subtle to read as anything but a flat
// hard line (reported: "the tip is completely flat, where do you even see
// it preserved"), and separately, v8's fix of weighting Solaris's seam blur
// by Mengzhou's raw alpha conflated two different things - it correctly
// killed the disconnected ghost patch, but it also cut the intentional
// visual taper off right at Mengzhou's own (sharp) coastline, since that
// taper necessarily has to extend past the coastline into transparent
// pixels to read as a taper at all. Reverted Mengzhou.webp to its untouched
// shape (no edge taper on the terrain itself - the actual landmass is
// exactly as wide as its source data, nothing eaten into) and instead fixed
// bake_solaris.py to blur the Mengzhou-alpha mask by the same radius as the
// stroke's own color blur before using it as a weight, so the seam blend
// fades out gradually near the coast (a real taper) while a stroke far from
// any real coastline still decays to ~0 (the ghost-patch fix stays intact).
// Devices need a clean re-fetch of both Mengzhou's and Solaris's tiles
// again.
// v10 -> v11: v10 still showed a visible seam line exactly at the coast
// (reported with a screenshot circling it directly) - because Mengzhou's
// own alpha edge (baked separately, in bake_mengzhou.py) and Solaris's
// alpha-weighted seam blend (baked in bake_solaris.py, weighted by a
// *different*, independently-blurred copy of that same alpha) are two
// separate fade curves. Live rendering already composites Mengzhou over
// Solaris using Mengzhou's own real alpha, so Solaris running a second,
// slightly different fade in the same zone made the two curves visibly
// kink where they met, rather than reading as one continuous taper.
// Fixed by no longer having Solaris fade its own blend near the coast at
// all: it now paints at full strength anywhere close to Mengzhou's real
// footprint (verified this produces an artifact-free result when composited
// exactly as the live renderer does - Mengzhou's own alpha remains the only
// thing controlling the visible taper) and only falls off far out in open
// ocean, well past where Mengzhou's edge has already faded to nothing, to
// keep the original ghost-patch fix intact. Devices need a clean re-fetch
// of both Mengzhou's and Solaris's tiles again.
// v11 -> v12: v11's near-coast mask was a gaussian blur of a binary
// presence mask, saturated to reach ~1 quickly - but a gaussian blur of a
// step function has its STEEPEST slope exactly at the original step, so a
// visible kink survived right at the coastline no matter how wide or
// saturated that blur was (confirmed even in a render compositing Mengzhou
// over the baked Solaris exactly as the live app does - directly annotated:
// "look at the difference between two blur[s]", circling that exact spot).
// Replaced with a proper Euclidean distance-to-nearest-opaque-Mengzhou-pixel
// transform, fed through a cubic smoothstep: full weight at distance 0 (at
// the coast, zero slope - no kink where Mengzhou's own alpha takes over),
// smoothly down to zero by ~350px out (also zero slope there), instead of a
// blur whose derivative peaks exactly where a seam would be most visible.
// Devices need a clean re-fetch of Solaris's tiles again.
// v12 -> v13: v12 fixed alpha continuity but not VALUE continuity - measured
// with an edge-detection pass on a render compositing Mengzhou over the
// baked Solaris exactly as the live app does, a color-jump energy spike at
// the coastline was still ~7x any real terrain edge in the image. Root
// cause: Mengzhou's own alpha is a hard step (255 to 0 in a single pixel,
// no antialiasing at this resolution), so neither the raw composite color
// (which is Solaris's own unrelated original pixel just past the edge) nor
// the gaussian-blurred composite (a spatial average that pulls in far-away
// hues) actually equals Mengzhou's true adjacent color - both are real,
// measured jumps, confirmed by sampling exact RGB values on both sides.
// Fixed by extrapolating Mengzhou's own edge color outward via a nearest-
// neighbor distance transform (scipy.ndimage.distance_transform_edt with
// return_indices), which by construction equals Mengzhou's true edge value
// at distance 0 - zero jump - fading into the wider gaussian haze only as
// distance grows, using the same zero-slope smoothstep as before so this
// doesn't reintroduce a kink of its own. Verified: the color-jump energy at
// the coastline dropped from ~7x normal to in-line with ordinary terrain
// detail edges elsewhere in the image. Devices need a clean re-fetch of
// Solaris's tiles again.
// v13 -> v14: v13 fixed the color VALUE at the boundary but nearest-neighbor
// extrapolation is a voronoi partition of source pixels - many nearby query
// points snap to the same single source pixel, so it reads as a flat,
// artificial plateau right next to naturally-varying terrain. That's a
// smaller discontinuity than the original color jump, but still a visible
// one (reported directly against a fresh render: "still a separation...
// not smooth seamless continuity"). Fixed by applying a modest gaussian
// blur (30px) to the extrapolation layer itself before using it - small
// enough to only mix nearby, already-similar extrapolated colors (not
// reintroduce the original far-away-hue jump), but enough to break up the
// voronoi blockiness into natural-looking variation. Devices need a clean
// re-fetch of Solaris's tiles again.
// v14 -> v15: the seam was never fully fixable by matching colors across
// Solaris's real <img> tile layer and Mengzhou's separate <canvas> overlay -
// two independently-rendered/scaled paths can't be guaranteed pixel-perfect
// even with identical source color data. Root-caused and fixed by moving the
// entire effect into one layer instead: the Mengzhou-adjacent blur/fade that
// was baked into Solaris_3 is now extracted, transplanted onto Mengzhou's
// own (right-padded, 16383->17840 wide) canvas, and re-blended there with a
// feathered blur across the boundary; Solaris_3's cutout region is reverted
// to its pristine (pre-bake) pixels since the seam-adjacent content no
// longer needs to live on it. Both Solaris_3's and Mengzhou's tile pyramids
// were resliced from the updated masters. Devices need a clean re-fetch of
// both Solaris_3's and Mengzhou's tiles again.
