/**
 * Real Fusion Burst stack accumulation and detonation timing (2026-09-06), replacing the old flat
 * "explosions = floor(rotTime/10)" guess with a real, sourced count. Sourcing (see
 * resolveFusionBurstStacks.js's own header for the full citation trail):
 * - Generic passive rule (verified via a direct fetch of a community database's Fusion Burst page, not
 *   the AI-chat text the user separately flagged as unverifiable): stacks accumulate on a target,
 *   auto-detonate and clear at the default cap (10).
 * - Aemeath's own base-kit override (her dump line 83): the same passive detonation fires early at
 *   >5 stacks instead of waiting for 10.
 * - Aemeath's own Duet cast (her dump line 87): a SEPARATE forced detonation at max stack, does NOT
 *   clear the passive counter.
 * - Per-hit stack values: Aemeath +1/hit (her dump line 83), Denia +1 (Basic combo) or +2 (Erosion
 *   Field) per her own dump line 92.
