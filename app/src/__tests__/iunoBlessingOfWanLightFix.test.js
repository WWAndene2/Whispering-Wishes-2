// Regression test found via a recommendation audit prompted directly by the user, who supplied real
// community write-up text for Augusta's recommended teammates: "Iuno is the best by far due to her
// high personal damage and giving a whopping 90% DMG Amplification effect to Augusta in total." Our
// scorer had Iuno ranked #5 for Augusta — BELOW Rebecca, Mortefi, Lynae, and Shorekeeper — the exact
// opposite of "best by far".
//
// Traced to two real data bugs in Iuno's kit (CHAR_BUFF_TABLE + the live TriggerBlock engine file),
// verified against two independent live sources (a community database, and a web search aggregating
// other guides) before touching anything:
//
// 1. Her outro's duration was 10s; both sources quote "The incoming Resonator gains 50% Heavy Attack
//    DMG Amplification for 14s" — no source found for 10s. (An earlier 2026-08-31 audit had actually
//    changed 14s to 10s, believing 14s had "no source basis" — that correction was itself wrong.)
// 2. "Blessing of the Wan Light" (+4%/stack all DMG Amp, max 10 stacks = 40%) was modeled as
//    `target: 'self'`, so it never reached any teammate — but both sources describe it as benefiting
//    "the receiving Resonator"/"whichever Resonator receives the shield" inside the Full Moon Domain,
//    not Iuno exclusively. 50% (outro) + 40% (Blessing, base kit) = 90%, matching the community figure
//    exactly. (The chain.s2-gated ADDITIONAL 40% was already correctly modeled as whole-team — only
//    the BASE-kit 40% had this bug.)
