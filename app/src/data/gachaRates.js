// WuWa gacha rates: 0.8% base, soft pity at 66, hard pity at 80
// Verified: community data mining (Steam analysis, pull trackers) confirms soft pity starts at pull 66
// Pulls 1-65: flat 0.8%. Pulls 66-79: linear ramp ~6.6%/pull. Pull 80: guaranteed.

// Average total income (Astrite-equivalent) a "usual" game update grants an F2P/light-spender
// player, for the Income Projections tab's 2nd-row/"By Banner End" average-update-income
// addition. Direct user-directed research (2026-09-13): sampled 6 recent patches (2.8, 3.1, 3.2,
// 3.4, 3.5, 3.6) from consistent-methodology community trackers (three
// independent sources), converting Radiant Tide/Forging Tide to Astrite-equivalent at this file's own
// ASTRITE_PER_PULL rate (1 tide = 1 pull = 160 Astrite) and averaging across F2P/subscription
// tiers where a source reported more than one. Raw per-patch totals ranged 11,845-18,390 (avg
// ~15,050); 12,800 was chosen as the standard figure per direct user instruction, to account for
// the not-full-completion vs. full-completion variance across sources (a conservative middle
// figure rather than the raw sampled average). AVG_UPDATE_DAYS is the same 6-patch sample's
// average real-world patch duration (35/42/42/32/42/41 days).

// overstates remaining income when only Phase 2 of a patch is left — real WuWa patches are
// front-loaded, with Phase 1 carrying new-area exploration/story rewards Phase 2 doesn't have).
// Sourced from 4 patches (2.5, 2.6, 3.1, 3.2) where a real Phase 1/Phase 2 Astrite split was
// found, using each phase's REAL day count from this file's own BANNER_HISTORY (banners.js) —
// not an assumed 50/50 split:
//   2.5: P1 6,500/21d=309.5/day, P2 2,280/13d=175.4/day
//   2.6: P1 9,950/20d=497.5/day, P2 4,180/21d=199.0/day
//   3.1: P1 14,560/21d=693.3/day, P2 4,960/20d=248.0/day
//   3.2: P1 7,040/21d=335.2/day, P2 5,440/20d=272.0/day
// Raw averages: P1 458.9/day, P2 223.6/day (P2 is consistently ~half of P1, not just shorter).
// Both scaled down by the same ~0.945 factor used to land AVG_UPDATE_ASTRITE/AVG_UPDATE_DAYS at
// the conservative 328.2/day baseline instead of that baseline's own raw sampled average, so the
// phase-specific rates stay consistent with the already-agreed conservative calibration.

// Activity Quests: 2,400" (over that patch's ~41 days ≈ 58.5/day) as part of the total this file's
// AVG_UPDATE_ASTRITE was calibrated from. PlannerTab.jsx's "including average update income"
// projections add these rates ON TOP of the player's own tracked `dailyAstrite` (which itself
// represents "commissions + dailies", per its own UI label) — stacking both double-counts the
// commissions portion twice. The fix is to subtract this commission-only rate from each AVG_UPDATE
// rate before adding it to the player's own tracked income, not to remove the player's own income
// (that portion is real and not part of the sourced totals) or to drop the whole AVG_UPDATE figure
// (the non-commission portion — events/exploration/tower/etc. — is genuinely additional). Only one
// patch (3.6) had an explicit "Daily Activity Quests" line item to source this from; applied
// uniformly across the flat/P1/P2 rates for lack of a larger sample.
