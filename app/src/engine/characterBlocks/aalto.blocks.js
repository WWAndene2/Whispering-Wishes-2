// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/characterBlocks/aalto.blocks.js
// [CHARACTER · AALTO] Aalto's TriggerBlock set — Layer 4 of the engine rewrite,
// migrated onto the single canonical schema (block.schema.js). Sourced from
// characters.js's already-audited CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Aalto'], RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA
// ['Aalto'], SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['Aalto'], and CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Aalto'] — no new
// numbers invented. Simple kit: every trigger is 'cast' or 'passive', no
// conditional/cast-order mechanics found.
//
// Completeness pass 2026-09-05, verified directly against `Data dump/
// Aalto/Aalto.md` (the real build-guide snapshot, not a derived table): three real,
// sourced kit moves (Heavy ATK, Mid-air Attack, Dodge Counter) and his Minor Fortes
// passive (Aero DMG+12%, ATK%+12%) existed in the dump and in SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['
// Aalto'] but had no block at all — his computed DPS was silently missing them.
// Added below. None of the three moves appear in CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Aalto'] (the
// dump's own "Rotation" section confirms his real optimal rotation never uses them
// either — Basic ATK/Skill/Liberation/Forte/Intro/Outro only), so these blocks are
// present and real but don't fire in the standard modeled rotation, same "sourced
// but currently inert" status as chain.s1/s3 below — not a fabrication, a documented
// gap between "real move that exists" and "used in his optimal play pattern."
//
// concertoEnergyGain added same pass, per user direction to treat Aalto as the
// blueprint other characters follow ("Team tab is a game engine"): his 3 real
// Concerto Energy values (Intro+10, Skill+15, Liberation+20) are now a real block
// field, summed by resolveConcertoEnergy.js's resolveConcertoEnergyGenerated() —
// not gating Outro timing yet (still CHARACTER_ROTATIONS' explicit 'Outro' step;
// making Outro actually threshold-derived is a larger, cross-character resolver
// change, out of scope for an Aalto-only pass), but a real computed number instead
// of documentation-only text with nothing reading it.
//
// Category-C completeness pass, same day: fixed every remaining "real, sourced, but
// entirely untagged" gap found in a line-by-line dump audit — Liberation's Gate of
// Quandary ATK+10%/10s (new buff block, scoped via scopedToBlockId to the two real
// Mist Bullet/Mist Missile blocks), the 2 Inherent Skills (new inert utility blocks,
// Perfect Performance/Mid-game Break), and corrected notes on chain.s1/s2/s6 and the
// Basic ATK block documenting real mechanics (Skill CD reduction, Mist-Avatar-taunted
// targeting, Gate-of-Quandary Heavy ATK scoping, stage-4 Mist-spread) that have no
// representable stat/condition/tagging granularity in this schema — not silently
// dropped, honestly noted as unmodeled.
//
// Full-kit cross-interaction audit, 2026-09-08 ("do all we did since start Hiyuki, on
// Aalto"): 2 real bugs found in the Resonance Chain, the same bug classes already
// fixed for Hiyuki/Lucilla this session.
//   chain.s4 ("Mist Bullets DMG+30%") was an unscoped skillDmg-CATEGORY buff — since
//   aalto.intro.feint-shot is ALSO skillDmg-categorized (a generic row label, not a
//   named Mist Bullet), it was silently also inflating Feint Shot's Intro damage.
//   Scoped to aalto.skill.shift-trick/aalto.forte.misty-cover only.
//   chain.s5 ("In Mistcloak Dash, Aero DMG Bonus+25% for 6s") was modeled as an
//   unconditional PERMANENT passive — a real, bounded 6s window (entered by casting
//   Shift Trick or Misty Cover, per Forte Circuit's own "passing through Mist/Gate of
//   Quandary enters Mistcloak Dash" text) credited for the whole fight instead. Split
//   into two real cast-anchored blocks (chain.s5-shift-trick/chain.s5-misty-cover),
//   both of which fire in his real modeled CHARACTER_ROTATIONS — a live fix, not moot.
// Confirmed correct, no changes: chain.s1/s2/s3/s6 (already correctly flagged as
// unmodeled-but-sourced or correctly broad in the prior passes), his Minor Fortes,
// Inherent Skills, and the Gate of Quandary ATK buff's own existing scoping. No
// self-kit resource-level mechanic (Mist Drops) was added: unlike Hiyuki's Snowforged
// Blade, there is no sourced real drop-count anywhere in the dump to model a leveled
// action against — modeling one would mean fabricating a number, which this file's
// own established convention (see aalto.skill.shift-trick's/aalto.forte.misty-cover's
// "no fabricated count" notes) already correctly declines to do. No dotApplier/
// appliesTags additions either: Aalto applies no shared negative status for another
// character to react to.
