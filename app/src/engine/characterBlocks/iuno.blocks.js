// Iuno converted to TriggerBlocks. Sourced from characters.js's already-audited
// CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Iuno'], RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Iuno'] (+ its own detailed
// 2026-08-31 audit comment, read directly for each node's real mechanic),
// SKILL_MULTIPLIERS['Iuno'], and CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Iuno']. No new numbers
// invented. S4 correctly has NO block — a pure defensive team shield with zero DPS
// component, per the audit's own zeroing.
//
// Fixed (Iuno Enhanced Moonbow sweep): Moonbow Basic ATK/Arc Beyond the Edge/Moonbow Dodge Counter
// were previously using their BASE (Sentience = 0) multiplier values under a claim that the
// Sentience-enhanced variant was "state/resource-gated per-hit... no home in this schema" — wrong.
// The dump's own text says the enhancement is a binary gate ("stay enhanced at ANY nonzero
// Sentience, not scaled by how much remains"), and her real modeled rotation's own Sentience math
// (100 at combo start, draining to exactly 0 only after the full sequence) keeps Sentience nonzero
// for every real cast — so the Enhanced values are what actually fire, not the base ones. A
// straightforward value correction (3 new SKILL_MULTIPLIERS rows added for the Enhanced variants),
// not a new engine capability.
