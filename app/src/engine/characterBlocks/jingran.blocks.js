// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/characterBlocks/jingran.blocks.js
// [CHARACTER · JINGRAN] Jingran's TriggerBlock set.
//
// Rewritten 2026-09-07 against a real .mht browser snapshot (Data dump/Jingran/
// Jingran.md, confirmed genuine via its own Snapshot-Content-Location header), captured
// 7/September/2026, showing "Version 3.6 (live)" — his real kit is now released. This
// replaces the prior 2026-09-06 sparse version (written ~4 days before his real release,
// from already-present-but-unconfirmed characters.js data, per direct user instruction
// "make the Jingran block even incomplete, he gets released in 3 days"). Every value below
// traces to that dump; no new numbers invented.
//
// Real, sourced fixes this pass made vs. the prior version (full rationale in the dump's own
// "App Data Comparison" section):
//   1. jingran.skill.netherworld-traverse / jingran.skill.afterlifes-guide were skillDmg —
//      the dump is explicit both are "considered Heavy Attack DMG." Fixed to heavyDmg.
//   2. Basic ATK Stage 3/4 (both stances) are explicitly "dealing Heavy Attack DMG," Stage
//      1/2 are not — previously one combined basicDmg block per stance; split into
//      Stage 1-2 (basicDmg) / Stage 3-4 (heavyDmg) blocks per stance.
//   3. Mid-air Attack and both Dodge Counter variants (Nether Dive/Light Watch) were
//      entirely missing — added. Both Dodge Counter variants are explicitly "considered
//      Heavy Attack DMG."
//   4. RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Jingran']'s S1/S3/S4/S5 were unsourced placeholders (no basis
//      in the real kit text) — zeroed in characters.js; S1/S2 rebuilt here as real
//      scopedToBlockId buffs (S1 scoped to its 4 named moves, 2 of which are heavyDmg not
//      skillDmg — an unscoped flat skillDmg buff would never reach them; S2 scoped to
//      Soul Raid/Stardome Meander only, since an unscoped heavyDmg buff would now also
//      wrongly hit Netherworld Traverse/Afterlife's Guide after fix #1 above). S3/S4/S5 are
//      real but have no representable DPS-stat form in this schema — documented as inert
//      utility blocks, not fabricated. S6's heavyDmg:40 was already correct; S6 also
//      carries 2 more real effects newly found (Chimei Wangliang DMG Multiplier +80%, and
//      the Parade of Thousand Souls proc mechanic) — both added.
//   5. Minor Fortes (Crit Rate+8%, HP%+12%) and both Inherent Skills (Hark the Dust, Trace
//      the Vestige) had no block at all — added, same completeness-pass convention as every
//      other converted character.
//
// Still correctly absent: CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Jingran'] does not exist — the dump's own
// guide content for him has no rotation/combo/team section written yet (confirmed in the
// dump's own "Build" section). Not fabricated here. Because of that, Jingran is still NOT
// part of BLOCKS_BY_CHARACTER's whole-team allMembersConverted gate in calcTeamStats.js
// (`BLOCKS_BY_CHARACTER[m.name] && CHARACTER_ROTATIONS[m.name]`) — a team including him
// still falls back to the legacy per-member RAW-tier formula and legacy FULL-tier buff
// accumulation, exactly as before. This file exists so that gap closes automatically the
// moment a real rotation is sourced, without another from-scratch rewrite.
//
// Basis corrected 2026-09-12 against a fresh build-guide snapshot (Data dump/Jingran/
// Jingran.md's own closing Meta-position paragraph): every damage.basis below was 'HP' (an
// unsourced inference modeled on Cartethyia's real HP-scaling kit) — the fresh dump explicitly
// states Jingran is "HP-CONVERTING (like Brant is with Energy Regen), not HP-scaling like
// Cartethyia — his multipliers apply to ATK, with HP only feeding the ATK-conversion and
// %-bonus passives." His own kit text ("Yang Changes, Yin Unites": flat ATK +36 per 1000 Max HP)
// already described an HP→ATK conversion passive, not a raw-HP damage basis — CONTRIBUTING.md's
// own basis-selection rule ("Only use 'HP'/'DEF' when the character's own kit text says
// explicitly the hit scales off that stat instead") was never actually satisfied for him. Fixed:
// every damage.basis below is now 'ATK' (the schema default), matching Brant's own ATK-basis
// HP-conversion blocks; the Outro was already correctly 'ATK'. CHARACTER_DATA['Jingran'].
// statScaling and its ROTATION_DATA/totalMult row in characters.js corrected to match in the same
// pass.
//
// Two real mechanics still have no home in this schema, honestly left unmodeled rather than
// guessed: (1) Soul Raid/Stardome Meander's Fire-of-Life-conditional HP-scaling DMG-increase
// component (a real, sourced per-1000-HP rate, but conditional on a depleting 100-cap
// resource with no `resourceGain`/`resourceStepOn` wiring built for it yet, and no
// CHARACTER_ROTATIONS to drive the simulation regardless); (2) Shadow Step's flat (non-%)
// `30+25` damage, explicitly immune to all DMG Bonus effects — not representable as a
// %-basis hit without guessing what stat the flat number scales from.

    note: 'S6 Parade of Thousand Souls: upon entering Yinghuo (via Liberation cast), dealing damage summons an extra Chimei Wangliang (Fusion DMG, considered Heavy Attack DMG), up to 1/second, max 8 summons over the 15s Yinghuo window — the real per-second/8-cap proc timing is not modeled (no CHARACTER_ROTATIONS to drive it), so this is recorded as a single real-valued instance anchored to the Yinghuo-entry cast rather than fabricating a repeat-count. Gated to sequence 6.',
