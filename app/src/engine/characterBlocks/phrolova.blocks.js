// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/characterBlocks/phrolova.blocks.js
// Phrolova converted to TriggerBlocks. Sourced from characters.js's already-audited
// CHAR_BUFF_TABLE['Phrolova'], RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA['Phrolova'] (+ its own detailed
// audit comment, read directly for each node's real mechanic), SKILL_MULTIPLIERS
// ['Phrolova'], and CHARACTER_ROTATIONS['Phrolova']. No new numbers invented. S5
// correctly has NO block — purely defensive, zero DPS component. The rotation's
// Liberation step name ("Waltz of Forsaken Depths") doesn't match SKILL_MULTIPLIERS'
// row name ("Curtain Call"), but both describe the identical mechanic (ends
// Resolving Chord, enters Maestro) — treated as the same move, sourced from Curtain
// Call's value.
//
// Corrected 2026-09-02 against a fresh the source dump (`Data dump/Phrolova/
// Phrolova.md`): her two Forte follow-ups (Movement of Fate and Finality / Murmurs
// in a Haunting Dream — 3 real CHARACTER_ROTATIONS steps) previously had no matching
// SKILL_MULTIPLIERS row at all, leaving S1's own +80% totalMult bonus permanently
// inert. Both moves now have real, sourced values and their own damage blocks below
// (S1 is live). Also added `phrolova.chain.s6-apparition`, a real S6-only damage hit
// (Apparition of Beyond-Hecate, 216.42% ATK) fired during those same two moves —
// previously entirely unmodeled, not just miscategorized (confirmed via the dump,
// absent from every prior source this file was built from).
//
// Also fixed 2026-09-02: `phrolova.liberation.hecate-attack` — Hecate's own attacks during Maestro
// were the largest previously-zero-contribution gap in her kit (Echo = 43.9% of her total damage per
// the source dump), despite SKILL_MULTIPLIERS' 'Liberation, Maestro State: Hecate' row already having
// real values for them — that row had simply never been converted into a firing block. Modeled as one
// representative tick anchored to the Liberation cast (same pattern as Denia's Erosion Field), not the
// real repeating/conditional off-field mechanic — see that block's own note. This also unblocked S6's
// separate +24% Enhanced Attack-Hecate multiplier (now scoped onto it via scopedToBlockId).
//
// Fixed 2026-09-04 (full 9-dimension re-audit, fresh dump): `phrolova.chain.s1`'s totalMult effect had
// no scopedToBlockId — `stats.totalMult` is a flat multiplier applied by resolveHitComposedDps.js to
// EVERY damage block a character has, so this was silently inflating ALL of Phrolova's damage (Basic,
// Skill, Heavy, Liberation, Echo), not just the two named Forte follow-ups the dump's own text scopes
// it to — the same unscoped-totalMult bug class already found and fixed on Jiyan. Scoped to
// phrolova.forte.movement-of-fate-and-finality (the only one of the two moves with its own block here).
