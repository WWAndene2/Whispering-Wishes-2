// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/dot/dotReactions.js
// [RESOLVER · DOT] Applies dotFormulas.js's math against a live team/rotation context.
// PHASE3_PLAN.md Stage 3, item 2/5: closes the "DOT reactions have no engine model at all" gap from
// Stage 0's coverage table. Frazzle/Erosion/Fusion Burst/Electro Flare/Tune Break are ICD-aware,
// hand-verified-against-the-reference mechanics that already live correctly in calcEngine.js
// (calcFrazzleDmg etc.) — porting their stack/tick math into TriggerBlocks would mean re-deriving
// already-correct formulas from scratch for no benefit. Per Stage 0's own conclusion for gear
// ("stays composed around the engine, not ported into TriggerBlocks"), this file applies the same
// treatment: it composes the existing calcEngine.js DOT functions using engine-derived inputs
// (rotation time from a real simulated team rotation, defMult/resMult from the engine's own
// calcDefMult/calcResMult), so Stage 4's rewrite can call one function instead of hand-wiring five,
// exactly mirroring calcTeamStats.js's own usage (calcTeamStats.js:941-953) rather than diverging
// from it.

 * that used to be composed here too, using the caller's own `mainResMult` as its fallback since it
 * had no single canonical element) was removed entirely (2026-09-05, direct user instruction) — see
 * dotFormulas.js's own note for why. `mainResMult`/`energyCycleFactors` are kept as accepted-but-
 * unused params rather than reworking every call site's positional arguments for a param that may
 * be needed again by a future non-Tune-Break mechanic.
 *
 * @param {Object[]} members  Same `mems` shape calcTeamStats.js passes to calcFrazzleDmg etc.
 * @param {number} rotTime  Rotation time to average against — pass rotTimeFromSteps(ownedSteps) for

 * @param {number} defMult  From calcDefMult(enemyDef, defShred, defIgnore) — same defMult used for
 *   the team's own per-hit damage, reused here unchanged (DOT reactions aren't def-ignore-gated
 *   differently than normal hits).
 * @param {number} resShred
 * @param {(element: string) => number} getEnemyRes  Same enemy-RES lookup calcTeamStats.js uses
 *   (keyed by element name, e.g. 'Spectro'/'Havoc'/'Fusion'/'Electro').
 * @param {number} mainResMult  Unused (see module doc above) — kept for call-site stability.

 * @param {Object<string, import('./triggerBlocks.schema.js').TriggerBlock[]>|null} [blocksByOwner]
 *   the engine-merge history (git log) Phase 2: each team member's own real TriggerBlocks, keyed by name — when
 *   supplied, migrated mechanics are resolved from real `dotApplier`-tagged blocks
 *   (`dotReactionsFromBlocks.js`) instead of `CHAR_BUFF_TABLE`'s flat fields. Omit only when
 *   blocks genuinely aren't available (falls back to the fully-legacy behavior for every mechanic).
 * @param {Object<string,string>|null} [stanceOverrides]  Manual/forced Resonance Mode per owner.
 * @param {Object<string, {type:string, skill?:string}[]>|null} [rotationsByOwner]  CHARACTER_ROTATIONS,
 *   keyed by owner (2026-09-08, direct user instruction: "wire the DOT calculator to real per-step
 *   firing instead") — when supplied, ALL FOUR migrated mechanics (Frazzle/Erosion/Fusion Burst/Electro
 *   Flare) only credit a dotApplier-tagged block for each REAL occurrence of its matching move in that
 *   owner's own modeled rotation, instead of crediting every dotApplier block that merely exists in a
 *   team member's kit regardless of whether the modeled rotation ever actually casts it. Omit for the
