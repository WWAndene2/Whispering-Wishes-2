// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/dot/dotReactionsFromBlocks.js
// [RESOLVER · DOT] The TriggerBlock-native replacement for dotReactions.js's per-character-table lookups.
// the engine-merge history (git log) Phase 2: the TriggerBlock-native replacement for engine/dot/dotReactions.js's
// composition of calcEngine.js's five DOT-reaction functions. Reads each character's real
// `dotApplier`-tagged blocks (triggerBlocks.schema.js's own doc has the full rationale) instead of
// CHAR_BUFF_TABLE's flat `debuffs`/`electroFlare` fields — SAME formulas, SAME constants, ported
// verbatim from calcEngine.js (see the engine-merge history (git log) Phase 1 for each mechanic's exact
// derivation), just a different data source. Tune Break is deliberately NOT ported here yet
// (the engine-merge history (git log) 1.5 — most complex of the five, already has extensive session-added
// mode-exclusivity logic on the legacy path; migrated last, once this simpler four-mechanic pattern
// is proven in real character migrations).
//
// Migration is per-character, not all-or-nothing: a character with a `dotApplier` block is read from
// here; the legacy calcEngine.js functions (dotReactions.js) still separately read CHAR_BUFF_TABLE for
// whoever ISN'T migrated yet. calcTeamStats.js is responsible for not double-counting a migrated
// character on both paths (the engine-merge history (git log) Phase 2's own per-character checklist tracks this).
