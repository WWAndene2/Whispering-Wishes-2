// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/dps/resolveHitComposedDps.js
// [RESOLVER · DPS] Per-hit, single-character damage resolver.
// Stage 1 prototype for the "totalMult → hit-composed DPS" design doc (PHASE2_PLAN.md). Proves the
// architecture end-to-end for ONE character's own rotation, standalone — NOT wired into
// calcTeamStats.js, NOT yet extended to team-level cross-character buffs landing on the target
// mid-combo (that's the natural next increment, reusing resolveSimulatedTeamRotation.js's routing,
// once this single-character slice is trusted).
//
// Proc composition (Yinlin S6 Furious Thunder-style discrete extra hits, declared via a block's
// `proc` field instead of `damage.hits`) is handled too, added same day: a 'windowed-proc' block
// already resolves through the exact same triggerFired()/triggerKey() machinery every other trigger
// type uses (its key only lands in a step's firedTriggers on the specific step where
// RotationSimulator.tryProc() actually succeeded), so no new firing logic was needed — this file just
// needed to stop skipping blocks whose real number lives in `proc` instead of `damage`.
//
// Sums REAL per-hit damage (block.damage.hits, populated so far only for Yinlin — see her block
// file) across a full simulated rotation, instead of calcTeamStats.js's single flat
// `totalMult × avgCrit × dmgBonus × ...` multiplication. For each hit landing at a real simulated
// time T:
//   1. Query which buff/debuff blocks are ACTIVE at exactly T (not time-averaged — see
//      blockWindows.js's `activeCountAt`, the point-in-time counterpart to
//      `timeWeightedAverageConcurrency`) and fold their effects into a stat snapshot for that instant.
//   2. Apply the SAME formula shape calcTeamStats.js's own FULL tier already uses per character —
//      calcAvgCrit/calcDmgBonus/calcDefMult/calcResMult, calcEngine.js's existing, already-tested
//      primitives, reused verbatim — but evaluated per HIT instead of per CHARACTER.
//   3. Sum every hit's damage, divide by the rotation's total simulated time.
//
// This is intentionally MORE PRECISE than totalMult, not merely a different way to reach the same
// number — a buff active for only half a combo now actually only buffs half the combo's hits,
// instead of getting uptime-averaged across a single flat multiplier. See the design doc for why
// exact equality with the legacy number is explicitly the WRONG verification bar.

/**
 * @param {import('./triggerBlocks.schema.js').TriggerBlock[]} blocks  One character's own block set.
 * @param {Object[]} steps  Real (or hand-built) rotation steps — same shape simulateRotation() takes.
 * @param {Object} enemyContext
 * @param {number} enemyContext.enemyDef  Enemy DEF at the relevant level.
 * @param {number} enemyContext.enemyRes  Enemy RES (%) to this character's element.
 * @param {number|{atk: number, hp?: number, def?: number}} baseStats  The character's own effective
 *   base stat(s) (before any %-buffs — those are applied per-hit from the point-in-time stat
 *   snapshot, same as calcTeamStats.js's own `mBase * (1 + atkPct/100)` pattern). A bare number is
 *   shorthand for `{atk: number}` — every hit is ATK-scaling unless its own block says otherwise via
 *   `damage.basis`/`proc.basis` (see triggerBlocks.schema.js's DamageHits doc — added for
 *   Shorekeeper's HP-scaling Discernment). Omitting `hp`/`def` when a block actually needs one
 *   throws rather than silently computing a wrong number off `undefined`.
 * @param {string} [targetElementLower]
 * @param {string} [targetRole]
 * @param {Object} [externalStats]  Gear-side stats (weapon pv, echo set bonuses) computed OUTSIDE
 *   this character's own TriggerBlocks — calcEngine.js's applyWeaponPv/applyFullEchoSet/applyEchoStats
 *   output, same shape as calcEngine.js's createStats(). Added into the flat baseline every instant
 *   starts from, alongside the character's own passive/buff blocks — this is how PHASE3_PLAN.md's
 *   Stage 0 finding ("gear stays composed around the engine, not ported into TriggerBlocks") is
 *   actually wired: without this, resolveHitComposedDps had no way to receive gear stats at all,
 *   silently computing kit-only numbers that could never match calcTeamStats.js's real, gear-inclusive
 *   ones. Omitting this param keeps every existing caller's behavior byte-identical (an empty/absent
 *   externalStats contributes exactly 0, same as before this param existed).
 * @param {number|null} [sequence]  PHASE3_PLAN.md Stage 3: the character's actually-owned Resonance
 *   Chain sequence level (0-6). Every `chain.sN` block requires its own numbered sequence to fire
 *   (derived from the id convention — see sequenceGating.js); everything else requires 0 (always
 *   available). Omitting this (default `null`) does NOT gate anything — every existing caller's
 *   behavior stays byte-identical to before this param existed (Stage 2 found this gap: chain blocks
 *   were firing unconditionally as if every character were fully R6-awakened). Pass an explicit 0-6
 *   to actually gate, matching calcTeamStats.js's own applyResonanceChain() semantics.
 * @param {number|null} [libUptime]  PHASE3_PLAN.md Stage 3 item 3: the character's real
 *   energy-cycle-gated Liberation uptime (0-1, from calcEnergyCycles()'s own `libUptime` field —
 *   1.0 once real ER investment clears the role's threshold, discounted down to a 0.6 floor
 *   otherwise). Only hits whose `damage.category`/`proc.category` is `'libDmg'` (i.e. actually
 *   Liberation-sourced, per each block's own category tag) get scaled by this — everything else is
 *   untouched. This is a MORE PRECISE gate than calcTeamStats.js's own `mult * (1 -
 *   libShare*(1-libUptime))` (calcTeamStats.js:973-978): legacy has no per-source damage split, so it
 *   approximates "the Liberation portion" as a flat 20%/35% share of the character's WHOLE totalMult;
 *   the engine already tracks each hit's real category, so it can discount exactly the
 *   Liberation-sourced hits instead of guessing a share of everything — same documented-improvement
 *   treatment Stage 3 item 1 already established for Resonance Chain's `target.scope` precision.
 *   Omitting this (default `null`) does NOT gate anything — every existing caller's behavior stays
 *   byte-identical to before this param existed.
 * @param {boolean} [cooldownSteadyState]  Root-caused during Stage 4 planning as the dominant
 *   still-unexplained factor behind the Stage 1 harness's roster-wide ~2x median ratio (see
 *   PHASE3_PLAN.md's Stage 4 kickoff section for the full investigation): `deriveStepsFromRotation`
 *   builds ONE non-repeating pass through a character's `CHARACTER_ROTATIONS`, and this function's
 *   `totalDamage / totalTime` implicitly assumes every hit in that pass repeats every `totalTime`
 *   seconds forever — true only for a hit whose own `timing.cooldown` is <= `totalTime`. A long-CD hit
 *   (Liberation nukes are typically 20-25s CD, routinely longer than a short combo's own ~9-20s pass
 *   length) gets counted at the pass's own cadence instead of its own real cooldown, over-crediting it
 *   by up to `cooldown/totalTime`. When `true`, every damage block with a `timing.cooldown` set has
 *   its damage scaled by `min(1, totalTime / cooldown)` — the steady-state fraction of "once per
 *   cooldown" actually sustainable within this pass's own length, not the pass's own (shorter,
 *   artificially inflating) firing cadence. Omitting this (default `false`) does NOT scale anything —
 *   every existing caller's behavior stays byte-identical to before this param existed.
 * @returns {{
 *   totalDamage: number,
 *   totalTime: number,
 *   dps: number,
 *   hitLog: {time: number, blockId: string, atkPct: number, damage: number, category: string}[],
