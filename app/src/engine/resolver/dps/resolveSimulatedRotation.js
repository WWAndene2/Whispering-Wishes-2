// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/dps/resolveSimulatedRotation.js
// [RESOLVER · DPS] Time-averaged, single-character stat resolver.
// The time-integration driver PHASE2_PLAN.md's stacking-mode gap actually needed.
//
// Every prior consumer of the engine (resolveTriggerBlocks(), called directly from a test) only
// ever answered "given ONE snapshot of firedTriggers, what stats result" — a single instant, not a
// timeline. That was enough to prove each trigger TYPE resolves correctly in isolation, but it has
// no way to answer "this buff re-triggered three times over a 40s simulated rotation — does it
// stack, refresh, or ignore the repeats?", because stacking-mode is fundamentally a question about
// behavior INTEGRATED OVER TIME, not about one instant. `STACKING_MODES` has been declared in
// triggerBlocks.schema.js and populated on real blocks (Rover: Electro's outro/selfbuff blocks
// specify `stacking: 'refresh'`; his Electro Flare debuff specifies `stacking: 'stacking'`) since
// the very first character conversion, without ever having a consumer that could enforce it.
//
// This module is that consumer. Given one character's block set and a REAL (or hand-built) step
// sequence, it:
//   1. Runs simulateRotation() to get the real per-step firedTriggers/ineligibleBlockIds/time.
//   2. For every 'buff'/'debuff' block with a real `timing.duration` (an actual continuous-uptime
//      effect, not a per-hit-scoped one — see the PER_HIT_SCOPED handling below), tracks every
//      activation window it opens across the WHOLE simulated timeline, honoring each effect's own
//      `stacking` mode: 'unique' ignores a re-trigger while a window is still open, 'refresh'
//      extends the open window's end instead of opening a second one, 'stacking' opens genuinely
//      concurrent windows (capped at `maxStacks` when the block's data specifies one).
//   3. Integrates each block's own window history against the full [0, totalTime] simulated span
//      using the SAME overlap-fraction arithmetic calcTeamStats.js's `overlapUptimeForSeg` already
//      uses for its own (single-instance) cross-character buff uptime — generalized here to sum
//      concurrent windows (for 'stacking') instead of a single 0/1 overlap fraction, since this
//      driver has to handle N possibly-overlapping instances of the same block where calcTeamStats
//      only ever had one. Same conceptual primitive, reused rather than reinvented; genuinely new
//      bookkeeping on top because nothing in either system previously had multiple instances of the
//      same buff to reconcile.
//   4. Produces one time-weighted average stat contribution per block/effect, applied through the
//      SAME applyBuff() switch every other part of this engine uses.
//
// Explicitly NOT handled here (see PER_HIT_SCOPED below): a 'cast'-triggered block with NO
// `timing.duration` (e.g. Shorekeeper's S6 — active for exactly the one Discernment hit, not a
// continuous window) represents a per-hit-scoped damage modifier, not a time-integrable uptime buff.
// Time-averaging a zero-duration event across a whole rotation would silently produce ~0% of its
// real value; treating it as always-on would silently produce 100% uptime it never has. Both are
// wrong in a different direction, so this driver deliberately does neither: it reports such blocks
// separately (`perHitScopedBlockIds`) instead of folding them into `stats`, honestly leaving "apply
// this to the one specific hit's damage" to the not-yet-built per-hit damage-application path (the
// same SKILL_MULTIPLIERS-per-hit migration PHASE2_PLAN.md already tracks as separate, larger work).
