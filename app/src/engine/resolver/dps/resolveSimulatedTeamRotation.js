// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/dps/resolveSimulatedTeamRotation.js
// [RESOLVER · DPS] Time-averaged, whole-team stat resolver.
// The team-level generalization of resolveSimulatedRotation.js — resolves what ONE team member
// (`targetName`) actually RECEIVES from a full multi-character rotation, not just their own kit in
// isolation. This is the piece PHASE2_PLAN.md's multi-character-interleaving pass deliberately left
// for "next": simulateTeamRotation()/buildTeamSteps() prove the TRIGGER conditions evaluate
// correctly across characters (Augusta's partner-outro-return chief among them), but nothing yet
// turns that into real per-character STAT totals the way resolveSimulatedRotation.js does for one
// character alone.
//
// Reuses timeWeightedAverageConcurrency() from resolveSimulatedRotation.js verbatim (exported from
// there specifically for this) — same stacking-mode window-building logic, generalized to integrate
// against an arbitrary RECIPIENT segment instead of always [0, totalTime]. That's the actual
// generalization this file adds: a block's effects can land on a DIFFERENT character than the one
// whose action triggered them (Augusta's own Intro cast opens a team-wide ATK+20% window; Yinlin, if
// she's on the team, receives it — the window is Augusta's, the recipient segment is Yinlin's own
// on-field span), matching calcTeamStats.js's overlapUptimeForSeg exactly: a buff's real uptime
// contribution is the fraction of its own active window that overlaps the RECIPIENT's own on-field
// segment, not the whole rotation.
//
// Scope of what's routed to `targetName`, by `target.scope`:
//   - 'self':          only from blocks whose `source` (owning character) IS targetName.
//   - 'whole-team':    from ANY block, applied to every team member (including its own source) —
//                       overlap is computed against targetName's own on-field segment.
//   - 'next-on-field': only from a block whose source is the team member IMMEDIATELY BEFORE
//                       targetName in team order (the character targetName's own on-field block
//                       comes right after) — matches how outro buffs already resolve everywhere
//                       else in this codebase (calcTeamStats.js's own outroStart()/'next' handling).
//   - anything else ('on-field', 'next-on-field' with no adjacency match, 'marked-enemy',
//     'all-enemies') simply doesn't match `targetName` and contributes nothing — not a gap, just out
//     of this function's scope (enemy-targeted debuffs are a different accumulator entirely, not
//     modeled here any more than resolveSimulatedRotation.js models them for one character).

 *   carries an `owner` field.

 * @param {string} targetName  The team member whose received stat totals to compute.
 * @param {Object} [opts]
 * @param {string} [opts.targetElementLower]
 * @param {string} [opts.targetRole]
 * @param {Object<string, number>} [opts.sequenceByOwner]  PHASE3_PLAN.md Stage 3: each team member's
 *   owned Resonance Chain sequence (0-6), keyed by name (same keys as `blocksByOwner`). A member
 *   missing from this map is NOT gated (every one of their blocks fires) — same no-gating-by-default
 *   backward compatibility as resolveHitComposedDps's own `sequence` param; omit the whole option to
 *   keep every existing caller's behavior unchanged.
 * @param {boolean} [opts.coordSnapshotDiscount]  PHASE3_PLAN.md Stage 3 item 4: pass `true` when
 *   `targetName` is an off-field Coordinated ATK character (legacy's own `isOffField` condition,
 *   calcTeamStats.js:1029: `dmgFocus.includes('Coordinated ATK') && dmgFocus.length <= 2`) to apply
 *   the same flat `COORD_SNAPSHOT_DISCOUNT` (0.6, see coordinatedAtk.js) legacy applies to buffs
 *   targeted 'next' — an off-field character doesn't actually receive a support's outro buff if that
 *   support swaps in AFTER them. Only `'next-on-field'`-scoped blocks are discounted; `'whole-team'`
 *   (continuous, swap-order-independent buffs like libBuffs) are left untouched, matching legacy's own
 *   distinction (calcTeamStats.js:1044-1052 discounts outro/Sonata-next buffs; :1081-1089's libBuffs
 *   loop has no discount at all). Omitting this (default `false`/falsy) does NOT discount anything —
 *   every existing caller's behavior stays byte-identical to before this option existed.
