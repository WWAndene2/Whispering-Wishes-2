// WHISPERING WISHES — engine/resolver/gating/triggerEngine.js
// [RESOLVER · GATING] The core trigger/condition resolver every other module here builds on.
// Resolves a set of TriggerBlocks (see triggerBlocks.schema.js) for a given team/
// rotation context into stat contributions, using the SAME applyBuff() stat switch
// calcEngine.js already uses — so a converted character's blocks feed the existing
// damage formula unchanged, and their output can be diffed against the legacy flat-
// table path (CHAR_BUFF_TABLE/RESONANCE_CHAIN_DATA) for verification before cutover.
//
// This module is additive: it does not modify calcEngine.js/calcTeamStats.js/
// autoEquip.js, and nothing in the live calculator imports it yet. It's exercised by
// the parity test in __tests__/triggerEngine-rover-electro.test.js.

 *                                          the same as passing an empty set, same as every prior call
 *                                          site that predates this parameter.
