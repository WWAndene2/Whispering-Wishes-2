// Loads the two spine-player runtimes dynamically rather than as static
// <script src> tags in index.html, so they don't block the initial page
// parse/paint — not needed until a Spine-animated character view is
// actually opened, well after boot, so the short delay before they're
// ready costs nothing. Called once, directly below.
//
// Vendored locally under public/vendor/spine-player-<version>/ (same
// pattern as /vendor/tmf/) rather than fetched from unpkg.com — these used
// to be CDN <script>/<link> tags, but that meant every Spine feature (the
// character detail modal's Assets sprite tile included) went silently
// blank with no fallback and no visible error whenever unpkg was slow,
// rate-limited, or unreachable on a given network. A same-origin file
// can't fail that way, and the SRI hashes that used to pin the CDN
// response no longer serve a purpose once the file ships in the app
// bundle itself. Vite's base './' means these must be resolved from
// BASE_URL like every other public asset (see TRACK_SRC in
// useAmbientMusic.js for the same fix), not a hardcoded leading slash.
//
// BUG this replaces: setting `.async = false` on dynamically-inserted
// <script src> tags only orders THEM relative to each other — it does
// nothing for the stash/restore <script> tags in between, which have no
// `src` and so run synchronously the instant they're appended, before
// either external file has actually fetched. In practice every "inline"
// step ran immediately back-to-back while window.spine was still
// undefined, so window.spine41 was left permanently undefined and
// window.spine ended up holding whichever external file's top-level `var
// spine = ...` executed last (4.1, clobbering the intended 4.2) — every
// SPRITE_SPINE_CHARACTERS lookup (the character detail modal's Assets
// sprite tile included) silently failed with `spineLib?.SpinePlayer`
// false and fell back to a static frame no matter how many times you
// tapped play. Fixed by chaining on each script's real `load` event
// instead of assuming insertion order.
